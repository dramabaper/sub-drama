00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.182 line:93%
(Episode 18)

00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:23.772 line:93%
Kang Pil Joo.

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:44.396 line:93%
(Pil Joo)

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.179 line:93%
(Mo Hyun)

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.269 line:93%
What are you doing here?

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.409 line:93%
Mr. Jang Boo Cheon.

00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:18.179 line:93%
Mother.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.808 line:93%
Grandfather.

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:28.919 line:93%
Did everyone know...

00:02:30.688 --> 00:02:32.259 line:93%
about me from the start?

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.588 line:93%
Yes.

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.098 line:93%
What about Uncle Jang?

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.538 line:93%
Him too.

00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:49.338 line:93%
Even Director Jang Yeo Cheon knew it too.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:52.438 line:93%
Everyone...

00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:57.449 line:93%
must have had fun...

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.149 line:93%
watching me,

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:09.528 line:93%
a stupid girl who came to live at Mooshimwon.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.769 line:93%
Yong Goo.

00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:58.979 line:93%
I saw Pil Joo's car outside before I came in here.

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:07.688 line:93%
Where are Pil Joo and Mo Hyun?

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:22.869 line:93%
Mo Hyun.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.079 line:93%
You jerk!

00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:37.678 line:93%
Boo Cheon.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:41.889 line:93%
Let's go home.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.168 line:93%
Let's check the last stage of the project.

00:05:02.738 --> 00:05:03.738 line:93%
Pil Joo.

00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:06.809 line:93%
- This isn't the right time. - Yes, it is.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.509 line:93%
We must act now.

00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:12.149 line:93%
Right now.

00:05:21.158 --> 00:05:22.189 line:93%
Mo Hyun.

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:36.439 line:93%
I'm relieved, Boo Cheon.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.048 line:93%
From the marriage Kang Pil Joo has set up,

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:48.019 line:93%
the love between us is real,

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:52.988 line:93%
but now,

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.129 line:93%
I don't have anything left...

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.098 line:93%
because you disregarded our relationship.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.199 line:93%
- Let's start. - Okay.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.809 line:93%
Just like you suggested, when Cheong A Bio is the holding company,

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.949 line:93%
I played around to see how I can group the affiliated companies.

00:06:48.178 --> 00:06:50.949 line:93%
We must hurry to get Daeil Distribution listed.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.619 line:93%
In order to make Cheong A Bio the holding company,

00:06:53.778 --> 00:06:55.319 line:93%
we must expedite getting Daeil Distribution listed...

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.149 line:93%
and merging these two companies.

00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:00.389 line:93%
Later on, when we consolidate Cheong A Bio and Trading,

00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:02.088 line:93%
we must make sure Cheong A Bio...

00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:04.658 line:93%
has legal authorities over every affiliated company of Cheong A.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.858 line:93%
Even if he is not a president anymore,

00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:09.399 line:93%
do you think Jang Seong Man will let this happen?

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.238 line:93%
I'm sure he will try to stop this...

00:07:11.468 --> 00:07:12.738 line:93%
with everything he's got.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.108 line:93%
And I plan on stopping...

00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:17.509 line:93%
every trick he plays...

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:19.778 line:93%
with everything I have too.

00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:24.379 line:93%
So you will make Cheong A Bio the holding company...

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.678 line:93%
and make Jang Boo Cheon the chairman.

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:29.019 line:93%
What's next?

00:07:29.588 --> 00:07:30.749 line:93%
I'm going to bring up a suit...

00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:34.689 line:93%
to revoke every inheritance Jang Boo Cheon has received...

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:37.288 line:93%
from Honorary Chairman Jang.

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:40.999 line:93%
As it's been over 10 years since he received shares of Daeil,

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:42.329 line:93%
I can't get it back.

00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:46.168 line:93%
But every inheritance that's been given in advance.

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:48.809 line:93%
I'm going to...

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.209 line:93%
take everything back.

00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:53.439 line:93%
Executive Jung...

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:56.348 line:93%
will go mad.

00:07:56.348 --> 00:07:58.019 line:93%
(Cheong A Bio)

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:06.858 line:93%
Executive Jung.

00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:09.129 line:93%
It seems like...

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:12.028 line:93%
you are not as sharp as before in handling businesses.

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.699 line:93%
I'm talking about Mo Hyun.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.269 line:93%
Father.

00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:22.238 line:93%
I was under the impression...

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:26.178 line:93%
that you took care of the son Soo Man had out of wedlock...

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:30.949 line:93%
from a long time ago without leaving any trace.

00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:39.818 line:93%
You failed to make her follow her father's footstep.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:43.089 line:93%
Boo Cheon is going to be the vice chairman soon.

00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.899 line:93%
The reputation of Boo Cheon has become important.

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:47.229 line:93%
Yes, Father.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:49.698 line:93%
Right now, I am helping...

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:53.438 line:93%
Mo Hyun so that she can conceive...

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.208 line:93%
Boo Cheon's child.

00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:59.308 line:93%
All right. If she asks for a divorce on the grounds of the affair,

00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:01.879 line:93%
it will greatly mar his reputation.

00:09:03.048 --> 00:09:05.149 line:93%
Try to comfort her.

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:12.519 line:93%
Oh, no! You can't walk in there. Hold on a second.

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:16.058 line:93%
- My goodness. - I didn't know Mo Hyun was feisty.

00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:18.399 line:93%
Speak of the devil.

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:27.499 line:93%
Grandfather, there's something I must tell you.

00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:32.739 line:93%
- Eun Shim. - Yes, sir.

00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:34.609 line:93%
I will show myself out.

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:42.318 line:93%
Okay. What is it that you want to tell me?

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:53.798 line:93%
How did you know that I like Poet Yoon Dong Ju?

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:57.198 line:93%
I read it on the newspaper before.

00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:00.239 line:93%
- I see. - In my early days,

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:02.438 line:93%
I liked storybooks,

00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:05.308 line:93%
so I wanted to become a writer.

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:09.078 line:93%
- I see. - I still have Boo Cheon...

00:10:09.448 --> 00:10:12.019 line:93%
read me books before I go to bed.

00:10:12.918 --> 00:10:14.519 line:93%
Every book has...

00:10:15.188 --> 00:10:18.418 line:93%
its climax and conclusion.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:21.028 line:93%
The same thing applies to our lives.

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:23.158 line:93%
After wandering like duckweed,

00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:25.729 line:93%
it finally reaches its conclusion.

00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:29.068 line:93%
- Mo Hyun, turn this off. - If you put a period at the end...

00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:31.139 line:93%
- What are you doing? - of your life yourself,

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:32.899 line:93%
- How rude of you. - your name will live in history...

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:35.109 line:93%
- How dare you? - for leading an independent life...

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:38.908 line:93%
- without being led by the nose. - Executive Jung.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.208 line:93%
Leave it.

00:10:40.678 --> 00:10:42.578 line:93%
- Father. - If you decide...

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.249 line:93%
to take all the responsibilities...

00:10:45.448 --> 00:10:48.548 line:93%
regarding this complicated matter and depart this life,

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:51.158 line:93%
as I still have a lot to do in this world,

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:54.759 line:93%
I'll make sure to take care of...

00:10:55.028 --> 00:10:56.589 line:93%
Mo Hyun and my great grandson.

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:08.568 line:93%
Playing this recording in front of me...

00:11:09.308 --> 00:11:12.979 line:93%
is the manner your father whom you respect taught you?

00:11:14.078 --> 00:11:16.308 line:93%
Do you think I went to visit your father at the hospital...

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.249 line:93%
and your father committed suicide...

00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:21.318 line:93%
instead being investigated because we are not...

00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:24.048 line:93%
- as honest as you are? - Grandfather.

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:27.219 line:93%
I played it because I only wish to know the truth.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.629 line:93%
A liar.

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:32.229 line:93%
You played it to criticize me. How dare you lie to me?

00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:37.328 line:93%
My version of the truth...

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:40.038 line:93%
is in the recording you played.

00:11:40.068 --> 00:11:41.509 line:93%
Your father's version of the truth...

00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:44.239 line:93%
lies in the suicide Congressman Na has chosen.

00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:46.178 line:93%
What more do you want from here?

00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:48.678 line:93%
The truth that made my dad commit the act.

00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:51.678 line:93%
Mo Hyun. Get up right now. Now!

00:11:51.719 --> 00:11:54.389 line:93%
If you're sad about your father's death,

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:55.788 line:93%
mourn his death.

00:11:56.188 --> 00:11:59.019 line:93%
Congressman Na left the will saying he'd take all the responsibilities.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:00.589 line:93%
Dishonoring your father's will...

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.989 line:93%
is the most undutiful act a daughter can commit toward her father.

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:05.729 line:93%
- Grandfather, I... - Shut your mouth.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.469 line:93%
I've lost all my affection towards you.

00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:10.269 line:93%
I don't even want to hear your voice.

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:15.509 line:93%
Executive Jung, from this point on,

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:18.379 line:93%
Mo Hyun is banned from coming to Mooshimjae.

00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:21.208 line:93%
- Grandfather. - Don't play the recording...

00:12:21.578 --> 00:12:23.379 line:93%
in front of me.

00:12:23.778 --> 00:12:25.818 line:93%
Take and report it to the police.

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:29.219 line:93%
Get out of my house!

00:12:29.318 --> 00:12:30.849 line:93%
You good-for-nothing witch!

00:12:40.428 --> 00:12:43.229 line:93%
Father, I'm sorry.

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:45.269 line:93%
If you took care of her the other day,

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:48.139 line:93%
this wouldn't have happened.

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.859 line:93%
What did you have to discuss with Grandfather?

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.369 line:93%
Boo Cheon.

00:13:21.408 --> 00:13:23.639 line:93%
I want to drink it, so I can get some sleep.

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:26.938 line:93%
- Give it back. - Let me...

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:31.448 line:93%
Let me tuck you to bed then. Let's go.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:06.719 line:93%
Mo Hyun.

00:14:16.229 --> 00:14:17.428 line:93%
What's wrong with her?

00:14:20.499 --> 00:14:23.469 line:93%
It seems like she had a drink in the dining room.

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:34.509 line:93%
The house is restless.

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.979 line:93%
It's never been this bad before.

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:40.649 line:93%
Why would you say that?

00:14:40.778 --> 00:14:42.288 line:93%
You're making me nervous.

00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:44.759 line:93%
It seems...

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:48.328 line:93%
Ms. Na is above average.

00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:52.158 line:93%
Why isn't she getting divorced?

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:56.028 line:93%
It doesn't look like she's after money.

00:14:56.599 --> 00:14:58.068 line:93%
For the last 30 years,

00:14:59.038 --> 00:15:01.139 line:93%
I've never told anyone about...

00:15:02.908 --> 00:15:05.078 line:93%
what happened in Gapyeong.

00:15:06.778 --> 00:15:09.578 line:93%
Then how does Father know?

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:14.889 line:93%
Gosh.

00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:19.418 line:93%
Was I fooled by his trick?

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:23.058 line:93%
Anyway,

00:15:23.729 --> 00:15:26.198 line:93%
he's worse than a 1,000-year-old snake.

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:31.438 line:93%
Father...

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.469 line:93%
hasn't given any directions yet,

00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:36.568 line:93%
but...

00:15:37.609 --> 00:15:40.278 line:93%
if he ever indicates about getting rid of Mo Hyun,

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:43.509 line:93%
you need to...

00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:45.479 line:93%
get it done right this time.

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:46.918 line:93%
Do you understand?

00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:52.359 line:93%
Father...

00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:56.458 line:93%
has opened up for Boo Cheon for the first time in decades.

00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:58.259 line:93%
If he closes his mind,

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.558 line:93%
Boo Cheon's out.

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:03.499 line:93%
I...

00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:07.168 line:93%
can't do that anymore, ma'am.

00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:13.208 line:93%
You haven't done anything for Boo Cheon as his father.

00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:15.649 line:93%
If you can't open up a path for him,

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.308 line:93%
you should get rid of the obstacles at least.

00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:26.359 line:93%
(Mooshimwon)

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:51.678 line:93%
Mr. Kang.

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:02.328 line:93%
Mr. Kang.

00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:27.178 line:93%
Did you know...

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:30.849 line:93%
Honorary Chairman Jang visited Congressman Na before he died?

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:33.289 line:93%
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:17:33.889 --> 00:17:37.389 line:93%
It's very sensitive matter. I kept it a secret.

00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:41.228 line:93%
You kept it a secret?

00:17:44.468 --> 00:17:45.599 line:93%
Kang Pil Joo.

00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:50.408 line:93%
Is your skill already rusted, or...

00:17:51.639 --> 00:17:53.539 line:93%
have you gone dull because it's about Mo Hyun?

00:17:57.248 --> 00:17:59.248 line:93%
Mo Hyun played a recording of...

00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:01.018 line:93%
Na Gi Chul and Honorary Chairman Jang's...

00:18:01.018 --> 00:18:02.918 line:93%
conversation in front of him.

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:09.728 line:93%
Did you say Mo Hyun you and Boo Cheon know...

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.958 line:93%
and Mo Hyun that I know...

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.198 line:93%
are different?

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:17.428 line:93%
She's...

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:20.198 line:93%
boiling water.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.408 line:93%
We'll end up getting burnt to death...

00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:26.609 line:93%
with boiling water...

00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:29.849 line:93%
because of her.

00:18:32.418 --> 00:18:35.849 line:93%
I'll make sure she'd never do anything that may upset...

00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:37.658 line:93%
Honorary Chairman Jang.

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:40.988 line:93%
She's already prohibited from entering Mooshimjae.

00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:44.359 line:93%
He's only...

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:48.928 line:93%
giving her a break for Boo Cheon's reputation.

00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:57.139 line:93%
You know that...

00:18:58.579 --> 00:18:59.839 line:93%
if Honorary Chairman Jang...

00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:02.809 line:93%
becomes furious,

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.379 line:93%
we'll be all dead.

00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:09.649 line:93%
Cheong A's...

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:13.119 line:93%
in a good atmosphere with news of a young vice chairman.

00:19:14.188 --> 00:19:16.029 line:93%
If Mo Hyun ruins it...

00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:20.059 line:93%
and bad articles appear, we'll be in trouble.

00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:27.668 line:93%
From now on, you must clamp down on her thoroughly.

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:32.309 line:93%
I told Ms. Na...

00:19:33.408 --> 00:19:35.408 line:93%
her marriage with Boo Cheon was my idea.

00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:38.149 line:93%
Why did you tell her that all of a sudden?

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:40.218 line:93%
She wanted to know.

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:42.789 line:93%
I thought she should.

00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:45.918 line:93%
Is that why...

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:48.658 line:93%
she drank so much?

00:19:56.498 --> 00:19:58.968 line:93%
Everyone struggled to bring her...

00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:02.639 line:93%
because she didn't want a blind date. What's her problem?

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.339 line:93%
Is she complaining about her first encounter...

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:07.438 line:93%
after five years?

00:20:09.978 --> 00:20:12.119 line:93%
If you didn't plan it for her,

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:15.988 line:93%
she could never have imagined of becoming Cheong A's daughter-in-law.

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:34.569 line:93%
What were you thinking?

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:40.408 line:93%
What were you thinking when you told Mo Hyun everything?

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.079 line:93%
Ms. Na...

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.049 line:93%
knew everything.

00:20:46.518 --> 00:20:48.289 line:93%
I couldn't hide it anymore.

00:20:49.418 --> 00:20:50.488 line:93%
About what?

00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:57.329 line:93%
Did she...

00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.829 line:93%
know...

00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:02.228 line:93%
everything?

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.399 line:93%
She even knew that your letter...

00:21:05.768 --> 00:21:07.198 line:93%
was fake.

00:21:07.738 --> 00:21:08.839 line:93%
Did she know...

00:21:10.408 --> 00:21:12.039 line:93%
you were the one...

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.178 line:93%
who gave her a piggyback too?

00:21:17.849 --> 00:21:18.879 line:93%
All of it.

00:21:24.218 --> 00:21:26.619 line:93%
I was bored waiting alone. I ordered first.

00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:28.529 line:93%
Wasn't it hard to find this place?

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:31.158 line:93%
Yes. I've never been here before. I got lost.

00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:32.899 line:93%
I didn't read the GPS correctly.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.168 line:93%
That's why she wanted to drink.

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:43.869 line:93%
That's where...

00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.609 line:93%
you followed her after seeing her...

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:49.779 line:93%
drunk.

00:21:56.518 --> 00:21:57.549 line:93%
Pil Joo.

00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:02.359 line:93%
I'm going to start again with her.

00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:05.758 line:93%
Over again.

00:22:09.198 --> 00:22:10.299 line:93%
Purely.

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:15.738 line:93%
The first meeting where I approached her intentionally...

00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:20.178 line:93%
has always bothered me like a fish bone in my throat.

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:22.978 line:93%
It's actually good.

00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:32.918 line:93%
Boo Cheon.

00:22:35.658 --> 00:22:36.928 line:93%
Let's just...

00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:39.958 line:93%
respect...

00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:41.768 line:93%
her decision.

00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:45.238 line:93%
We...

00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:48.569 line:93%
only hurt her by approaching her intentionally.

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:51.238 line:93%
When you say...

00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:53.309 line:93%
you want to start over,

00:22:54.849 --> 00:22:56.849 line:93%
it might pressure her.

00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:58.248 line:93%
Did you...

00:23:00.678 --> 00:23:02.649 line:93%
tell her everything...

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:05.789 line:93%
so that you can be with her later?

00:23:07.988 --> 00:23:11.099 line:93%
If that's what you're after,

00:23:11.498 --> 00:23:12.698 line:93%
you'd better give up now.

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:32.649 line:93%
Listen to me, you jerk.

00:23:32.948 --> 00:23:33.978 line:93%
Okay?

00:23:34.518 --> 00:23:35.688 line:93%
I'm...

00:23:36.849 --> 00:23:37.889 line:93%
not...

00:23:38.658 --> 00:23:40.688 line:93%
interested in anything else...

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:44.529 line:93%
but making you the chairman.

00:23:47.668 --> 00:23:48.728 line:93%
Do you understand?

00:23:55.539 --> 00:23:57.839 line:93%
Mo Hyun was dreaming.

00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:01.248 line:93%
She called your name.

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:03.208 line:93%
Pil Joo.

00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:07.049 line:93%
Don't approach her.

00:24:09.018 --> 00:24:10.119 line:93%
Do me a favor.

00:24:14.658 --> 00:24:17.258 line:93%
Even if she calls your name 1,000 times in her sleep,

00:24:17.258 --> 00:24:18.658 line:93%
I'll take care of it.

00:24:19.829 --> 00:24:20.829 line:93%
You...

00:24:23.198 --> 00:24:24.639 line:93%
better stay away.

00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:46.518 line:93%
If I were to express my opinion as a shareholder of Daeil Distribution,

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:48.129 line:93%
I believe...

00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:51.399 line:93%
we should make the company be listed...

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.928 line:93%
- even if it costs a lot. - It's been 30 years...

00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:57.428 line:93%
since I inherited Daeil Distribution from my late father.

00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:00.268 line:93%
I believe it should've been listed a long time ago.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.279 line:93%
What's the biggest problem now?

00:25:05.478 --> 00:25:09.208 line:93%
The fact that Daeil Distribution grew up...

00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:10.879 line:93%
with jobs given by Cheong A...

00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:12.619 line:93%
is the biggest obstacle.

00:25:14.948 --> 00:25:18.089 line:93%
Of course, it's not against the law,

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:19.819 line:93%
but if words get out,

00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:22.059 line:93%
it'll harm the reputation of both...

00:25:22.228 --> 00:25:23.529 line:93%
international distribution and domestic delivery service.

00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:25.428 line:93%
We should be careful.

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.428 line:93%
Proceed.

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:31.938 line:93%
I just made an urgent suggestion.

00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:35.339 line:93%
Daeil Distribution needs to freshen up its reputation...

00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:38.079 line:93%
at the same time it is listed.

00:25:38.708 --> 00:25:41.748 line:93%
Honorary Chairman Jang has suggested...

00:25:41.948 --> 00:25:44.109 line:93%
Director Jang Boo Cheon and Executive Jung Mal Ran...

00:25:44.178 --> 00:25:46.819 line:93%
to donate part of their shares as major stockholders...

00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:49.649 line:93%
to socially disadvantaged class.

00:25:49.988 --> 00:25:50.988 line:93%
Hey.

00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:56.789 line:93%
Father.

00:25:57.899 --> 00:25:59.958 line:93%
If you told us in advance,

00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:03.799 line:93%
we would've come up with the amount carefully.

00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:06.998 line:93%
The chairman's suggesting 500 billion dollars.

00:26:10.668 --> 00:26:11.678 line:93%
Then...

00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:16.109 line:93%
Cheong A Foundation can manage the fund.

00:26:16.478 --> 00:26:17.478 line:93%
Yes, ma'am.

00:26:18.478 --> 00:26:22.248 line:93%
Cheong A Foundation will manage the fund for sure.

00:26:25.619 --> 00:26:28.688 line:93%
Grandfather. I need time to think about it.

00:26:28.928 --> 00:26:31.158 line:93%
Are you saying you won't take my opinion?

00:26:31.658 --> 00:26:33.529 line:93%
I'm a major shareholder of Daeil Distribution.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:36.698 line:93%
Because the honorary chairman has invested Cheong A Bio in kind...

00:26:36.698 --> 00:26:38.268 line:93%
for Daeil Distribution shares,

00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:40.468 line:93%
he has a right as a major shareholder.

00:26:41.238 --> 00:26:43.869 line:93%
Of course, you have a right.

00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:49.478 line:93%
Cheong A Foundation will manage the fund, Boo Cheon.

00:27:02.158 --> 00:27:03.188 line:93%
Mom.

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:05.998 line:93%
Do you think Pil Joo really didn't know...

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:10.829 line:93%
and suddenly delivered it on behalf of Grandfather?

00:27:11.698 --> 00:27:13.039 line:93%
I do.

00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:15.609 line:93%
Even if...

00:27:16.309 --> 00:27:17.978 line:93%
he knew,

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:21.349 line:93%
he probably had a reason.

00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:25.319 line:93%
Mom. You trust him so much.

00:27:26.379 --> 00:27:28.448 line:93%
What if he betrays you?

00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:31.658 line:93%
How are you going to handle that?

00:27:31.918 --> 00:27:33.289 line:93%
You think so?

00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:36.958 line:93%
That's unimaginable.

00:27:38.158 --> 00:27:39.998 line:93%
Mom. Pil Joo is...

00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:45.599 line:93%
You...

00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:48.738 line:93%
don't know...

00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:50.609 line:93%
his serious stare.

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.208 line:93%
Those eyes.

00:27:54.609 --> 00:27:56.379 line:93%
They can't possibly betray me.

00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:00.678 line:93%
I may not know anything else,

00:28:01.418 --> 00:28:04.018 line:93%
but I can read him.

00:28:05.589 --> 00:28:06.619 line:93%
Think of it as...

00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:10.629 line:93%
he's doing this for you who is his owner.

00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:22.908 line:93%
He'll explain it to you.

00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:40.758 line:93%
Boo Cheon. Executive Jung.

00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:43.389 line:93%
I'm sorry...

00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:45.899 line:93%
I couldn't tell you about Daeil Distribution donation in advance.

00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:01.948 line:93%
Does it have to be that big?

00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:04.918 line:93%
I know we must steal the heart of the next president.

00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:08.549 line:93%
We must donate the amount that exceeds people's imagination...

00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:10.319 line:93%
to move their hearts.

00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:14.389 line:93%
This donation will make...

00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:16.458 line:93%
Cheong A's impression good, sir.

00:29:18.158 --> 00:29:19.258 line:93%
Then...

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:22.569 line:93%
we should discuss it with...

00:29:22.829 --> 00:29:24.069 line:93%
Executive Jung and Boo Cheon.

00:29:24.168 --> 00:29:26.069 line:93%
I think it should be a surprise...

00:29:26.168 --> 00:29:27.908 line:93%
which you enjoy.

00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:31.039 line:93%
If Executive Jung finds out,

00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:34.139 line:93%
she'd want to adjust the amount.

00:29:34.448 --> 00:29:36.908 line:93%
And if Boo Cheon goes against it...

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:39.349 line:93%
and the press finds out about it,

00:29:39.478 --> 00:29:40.819 line:93%
people will say...

00:29:41.418 --> 00:29:44.389 line:93%
it was a fund raising the government.

00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:47.728 line:93%
Then it will be worse than...

00:29:47.988 --> 00:29:50.228 line:93%
not donating at all, sir.

00:30:00.238 --> 00:30:01.539 line:93%
(Cheong A Foundation Intranet)

00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:04.208 line:93%
(This account does not have an access.)

00:30:17.619 --> 00:30:20.789 line:93%
This is the accounting data you requested.

00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:23.589 line:93%
Yes, Thank you.

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:25.158 line:93%
Also,

00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:29.069 line:93%
there's accounting data that I can't open in the internal network.

00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:30.899 line:93%
Yes. Actually...

00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:34.438 line:93%
only Executive Jung and Executive Park...

00:30:34.468 --> 00:30:36.268 line:93%
can open it.

00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:37.809 line:93%
It's blocked.

00:30:38.738 --> 00:30:39.738 line:93%
Okay.

00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:52.518 line:93%
Mo Hyun. I'm ready.

It's the woman...

Boo Cheon met before we got married.

00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:19.279 line:93%
- Her child is five years old. - Stop it.

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:24.319 line:93%
The details are for Boo Cheon.

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:25.819 line:93%
You don't need to tell me.

00:31:28.529 --> 00:31:31.158 line:93%
Divorce him, and come back home.

00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:34.569 line:93%
I still have energy.

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:38.139 line:93%
I'll help you to become happier than before...

00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:39.438 line:93%
when you come back.

00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:41.869 line:93%
Let it go.

00:31:42.069 --> 00:31:44.779 line:93%
Move on. Don't leave any feelings behind. Come back immediately.

00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:47.539 line:93%
I'm not saying anything...

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:49.908 line:93%
because you still live there.

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:51.518 line:93%
There's...

00:31:53.718 --> 00:31:55.418 line:93%
something I must do...

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:00.889 line:93%
before I divorce him.

00:32:04.258 --> 00:32:05.758 line:93%
Wait for me, Mom.

00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:15.268 line:93%
When I was young,

00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:18.879 line:93%
you were sitting down all exhausted,

00:32:19.609 --> 00:32:22.849 line:93%
so I asked you why you were so exhausted, and you said that...

00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:25.718 line:93%
there was a dream...

00:32:25.748 --> 00:32:27.688 line:93%
you wanted to accomplish desperately.

00:32:28.018 --> 00:32:29.389 line:93%
But you were incompetent and powerless...

00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:31.589 line:93%
to accomplish it.

00:32:32.688 --> 00:32:34.119 line:93%
So you were sad.

00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:38.228 line:93%
Your dream will be accomplished now.

00:32:38.228 --> 00:32:39.629 line:93%
Not the money,

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:41.998 line:93%
but your sincerity...

00:32:42.968 --> 00:32:44.539 line:93%
helped you.

00:33:29.349 --> 00:33:30.708 line:93%
Did you look for me, Mother?

00:33:47.869 --> 00:33:49.799 line:93%
We should settle...

00:33:50.968 --> 00:33:52.639 line:93%
what Grandfather yelled at you for.

00:33:55.139 --> 00:33:56.369 line:93%
Let me ask you one thing.

00:33:57.339 --> 00:33:59.339 line:93%
Why did you take it to Mooshimjae?

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:01.609 line:93%
This place is connected to my dad.

00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:04.879 line:93%
I wanted to know the truth about Cheong A.

00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:08.619 line:93%
My dad was a righteous and sincere politician all his life.

00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:11.219 line:93%
I needed to know why he received money from Cheong A...

00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:14.288 line:93%
and decided to take his own life.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.129 line:93%
Why haven't you asked me earlier?

00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:25.699 line:93%
He just...

00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:28.509 line:93%
wanted to become president...

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.239 line:93%
so desperately.

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:34.649 line:93%
That is the only truth about Congressman Na, Mo Hyun.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.949 line:93%
He wanted to satisfy...

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.759 line:93%
his earnest desire...

00:34:48.029 --> 00:34:49.688 line:93%
and realize his dream.

00:34:50.458 --> 00:34:52.558 line:93%
He was drawn close to Cheong A by fate.

00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:54.668 line:93%
Then he was driven...

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.839 line:93%
to the corner hopelessly,

00:34:58.868 --> 00:35:01.438 line:93%
so he gave up...

00:35:02.708 --> 00:35:04.279 line:93%
both on his dream and life.

00:35:07.808 --> 00:35:08.909 line:93%
I also...

00:35:10.009 --> 00:35:11.248 line:93%
have earnest desire...

00:35:12.078 --> 00:35:15.018 line:93%
to make Boo Cheon the chairman of Cheong A,

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.518 line:93%
so I understand Congressman Na.

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:21.359 line:93%
Should I interpret it this way?

00:35:23.188 --> 00:35:25.929 line:93%
Cheong A could bring him anything...

00:35:27.828 --> 00:35:29.868 line:93%
and make everything possible...

00:35:29.899 --> 00:35:31.899 line:93%
as long as he wanted.

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:34.668 line:93%
So he tried to become president...

00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:37.208 line:93%
with the help of Cheong A.

00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:45.279 line:93%
What did Cheong A earn by giving money to my dad?

00:35:50.388 --> 00:35:53.219 line:93%
I'm sure it didn't give him money...

00:35:54.388 --> 00:35:56.359 line:93%
just to realize his dream.

00:35:58.228 --> 00:36:00.359 line:93%
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.

00:36:01.668 --> 00:36:03.799 line:93%
Pil Joo told me that you set me up...

00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:06.938 line:93%
to meet Boo Cheon according to your plan...

00:36:06.938 --> 00:36:08.268 line:93%
to have my dad as your in-law.

00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:11.509 line:93%
So what?

00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:13.839 line:93%
What do you want from me now?

00:36:18.819 --> 00:36:20.518 line:93%
I want some consolation.

00:36:24.219 --> 00:36:25.759 line:93%
How could I console you?

00:36:26.319 --> 00:36:28.629 line:93%
I can't soothe you in my arms like a little baby.

00:36:34.529 --> 00:36:35.899 line:93%
Give me money.

00:36:40.768 --> 00:36:43.109 line:93%
I'll consult my lawyer...

00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:46.379 line:93%
how much I should demand you...

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:48.279 line:93%
for compensation and let you know.

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:20.578 line:93%
I was talking about the old days with Dr. Hwang over our cups,

00:37:21.609 --> 00:37:23.609 line:93%
and I suddenly missed you, so I came here.

00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:26.719 line:93%
I'm glad you came here.

00:37:27.888 --> 00:37:30.319 line:93%
Dr. Hwang worked really hard...

00:37:30.319 --> 00:37:31.958 line:93%
to save Attorney Kang.

00:37:35.388 --> 00:37:38.929 line:93%
Dr. Hwang told me how much...

00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:42.069 line:93%
you cared for Attorney Kang,

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:46.069 line:93%
and it quite broke my heart.

00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:50.409 line:93%
You'd been excessively strict...

00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:53.578 line:93%
to me and my brother.

00:38:02.388 --> 00:38:04.759 line:93%
Your decision to remove the oxygen tank...

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:06.418 line:93%
from Soo Man was very harsh...

00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:10.429 line:93%
when we still could wait longer for his recovery.

00:38:10.429 --> 00:38:12.228 line:93%
Watching that big man...

00:38:12.228 --> 00:38:15.228 line:93%
subsisting his life on the oxygen tank was terrible.

00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:18.038 line:93%
Actually,

00:38:19.138 --> 00:38:21.708 line:93%
right after you ordered them to remove his oxygen tank,

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:26.038 line:93%
he showed some progress.

00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:33.078 line:93%
But I told the doctor not to tell you...

00:38:33.418 --> 00:38:35.888 line:93%
since the progress was too subtle and meaningless.

00:38:39.618 --> 00:38:40.659 line:93%
Even if...

00:38:41.558 --> 00:38:44.929 line:93%
the progress might have meant nothing to me and you,

00:38:46.429 --> 00:38:48.328 line:93%
Boo Cheon and Mal Ran...

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:52.598 line:93%
could've seen it as a hope if they knew it.

00:38:53.899 --> 00:38:56.308 line:93%
So I feel quite bad for them.

00:38:57.268 --> 00:39:00.578 line:93%
We shortened the painful time for Soo Man.

00:39:00.949 --> 00:39:02.609 line:93%
We should see it that way.

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:08.348 line:93%
By the way, is Yeo Cheon doing fine there?

00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:09.719 line:93%
He is.

00:39:10.188 --> 00:39:13.558 line:93%
It must be hard for him as he had never faced such hardships,

00:39:13.618 --> 00:39:16.228 line:93%
but he sounds bright and reliable over the phone.

00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:24.129 line:93%
He seems to have grown up.

00:39:24.998 --> 00:39:28.739 line:93%
Why don't you tell him to come back?

00:39:28.739 --> 00:39:30.768 line:93%
He needs to be there for a full year...

00:39:31.138 --> 00:39:32.379 line:93%
so that everyone knows...

00:39:32.379 --> 00:39:36.109 line:93%
that I'm merciless to those who harm Cheong A.

00:39:36.848 --> 00:39:38.779 line:93%
There is no way he comes back already.

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:43.618 line:93%
Making him leave Cheong A would be better.

00:39:44.418 --> 00:39:46.719 line:93%
It's too harsh...

00:39:46.888 --> 00:39:50.058 line:93%
for such a young man to stay far away.

00:39:50.058 --> 00:39:52.199 line:93%
Punishment must be harsh.

00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:56.498 line:93%
Stop talking nonsense pretending to be drunk, and leave.

00:39:56.699 --> 00:39:58.038 line:93%
I'm tired.

00:40:14.788 --> 00:40:16.649 line:93%
Although it was short, I had a deep sleep.

00:40:17.759 --> 00:40:18.958 line:93%
When did you get here?

00:40:23.029 --> 00:40:25.228 line:93%
I just got here. Were you waiting for me?

00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:28.868 line:93%
Yes, I have something to consult you.

00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:33.668 line:93%
I was recognized to be competent in running business...

00:40:33.668 --> 00:40:35.069 line:93%
when I worked for Cheong A Bio, right?

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:38.538 line:93%
Right. You did a great job in Cheong A Bio.

00:40:38.779 --> 00:40:39.938 line:93%
You also did your best.

00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:41.308 line:93%
Do you think so?

00:40:41.848 --> 00:40:44.549 line:93%
I need to hold an additional post of the president at Cheong A Bio...

00:40:46.049 --> 00:40:48.618 line:93%
even after I become the vice chairman.

00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:52.288 line:93%
If the current project for...

00:40:52.288 --> 00:40:54.529 line:93%
Alzheimer's new treatment succeeds,

00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:56.629 line:93%
it'll change the game for the bio industry internationally.

00:40:56.629 --> 00:41:00.529 line:93%
Then I must stay at Cheong A Bio in order to get credit for it.

00:41:00.728 --> 00:41:01.969 line:93%
That's a good idea.

00:41:03.299 --> 00:41:04.768 line:93%
I knew you'd support it.

00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:08.509 line:93%
I need you to give full support for my idea...

00:41:08.638 --> 00:41:11.078 line:93%
at the upcoming directors' meeting.

00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:13.208 line:93%
Sure.

00:41:15.978 --> 00:41:16.978 line:93%
What?

00:41:17.819 --> 00:41:19.449 line:93%
Are you about to say that...

00:41:19.879 --> 00:41:23.149 line:93%
there's nothing more for me to learn from you?

00:41:25.819 --> 00:41:26.859 line:93%
Pil Joo,

00:41:27.388 --> 00:41:28.888 line:93%
I need you to teach me...

00:41:29.288 --> 00:41:31.328 line:93%
how to shoot well like you before you say that.

00:41:33.828 --> 00:41:36.429 line:93%
I went to practice shooting with Secretary Oh recently...

00:41:36.668 --> 00:41:38.199 line:93%
as I thought it was good for concentration.

00:41:39.199 --> 00:41:40.268 line:93%
Would you join us?

00:41:41.009 --> 00:41:42.339 line:93%
Sure.

00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:25.308 line:93%
Such a coward.

00:43:28.149 --> 00:43:30.679 line:93%
It's not loaded.

00:43:35.118 --> 00:43:36.118 line:93%
Let's have a break.

00:43:36.118 --> 00:43:37.188 line:93%
You can have it alone.

00:43:38.618 --> 00:43:41.029 line:93%
I'll practice more while you're gone.

00:43:43.029 --> 00:43:45.299 line:93%
I feel intimidated next to you,

00:43:46.429 --> 00:43:48.268 line:93%
so my shooting is worse than usual.

00:44:18.529 --> 00:44:19.529 line:93%
Secretary Oh.

00:44:21.328 --> 00:44:23.268 line:93%
Please kill Pil Joo for me.

00:44:24.098 --> 00:44:25.098 line:93%
Pardon?

00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:29.009 line:93%
I'm kidding.

00:44:30.308 --> 00:44:31.808 line:93%
It's just a joke today,

00:44:33.308 --> 00:44:35.308 line:93%
but you should do it for me...

00:44:36.478 --> 00:44:37.779 line:93%
when I ask you seriously later.

00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:43.879 line:93%
Secretary Oh.

00:45:45.319 --> 00:45:46.348 line:93%
Boo Cheon will soon...

00:45:47.348 --> 00:45:49.819 line:93%
become the vice chairman...

00:45:50.149 --> 00:45:51.489 line:93%
and the chairman.

00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:53.359 line:93%
Before that,

00:45:54.728 --> 00:45:56.859 line:93%
why don't you leave Mooshimwon?

00:45:58.629 --> 00:46:00.429 line:93%
Why should I leave?

00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:03.228 line:93%
It just occurred to me...

00:46:03.529 --> 00:46:04.969 line:93%
when I saw you.

00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:07.868 line:93%
It's for Boo Cheon.

00:46:09.569 --> 00:46:11.009 line:93%
Do you know what my wish is?

00:46:14.509 --> 00:46:16.078 line:93%
I want to live...

00:46:18.418 --> 00:46:19.949 line:93%
just one day longer than Executive Jung.

00:46:23.388 --> 00:46:24.819 line:93%
If I leave Mooshimwon,

00:46:26.259 --> 00:46:29.529 line:93%
I won't be able to know how she's doing.

00:46:30.058 --> 00:46:32.199 line:93%
If Executive Jung dies today,

00:46:33.899 --> 00:46:34.969 line:93%
Mr. Oh Ki Pyung,

00:46:35.799 --> 00:46:37.299 line:93%
you will be dying tomorrow.

00:46:39.138 --> 00:46:40.268 line:93%
Don't you care...

00:46:41.308 --> 00:46:42.308 line:93%
about Boo Cheon?

00:46:46.909 --> 00:46:48.009 line:93%
I can't...

00:46:49.279 --> 00:46:51.518 line:93%
take care of him as a father after all.

00:46:58.589 --> 00:47:00.518 line:93%
What are you guys talking about so seriously?

00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:09.668 line:93%
Secretary Oh regrets...

00:47:10.629 --> 00:47:12.199 line:93%
that he's...

00:47:13.138 --> 00:47:15.138 line:93%
growing old single.

00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:20.509 line:93%
Why would you regret it?

00:47:21.078 --> 00:47:22.978 line:93%
You can marry a woman now.

00:47:24.319 --> 00:47:25.449 line:93%
It's not too late...

00:47:27.989 --> 00:47:29.688 line:93%
to have a son.

00:47:32.788 --> 00:47:36.129 line:93%
Please don't leave Mooshimwon even if you get married.

00:47:38.699 --> 00:47:40.659 line:93%
Once Mo Hyun and I have children,

00:47:41.899 --> 00:47:43.728 line:93%
you should make wooden horses for them.

00:48:39.288 --> 00:48:40.288 line:93%
Executive Jung.

00:48:41.058 --> 00:48:42.529 line:93%
He's become...

00:48:43.159 --> 00:48:45.859 line:93%
the vice chairman of Cheong A Group as of today.

00:48:48.868 --> 00:48:51.199 line:93%
Mom. I'm Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon...

00:48:51.438 --> 00:48:53.239 line:93%
of Cheong A Group.

00:49:03.379 --> 00:49:04.518 line:93%
Cheong A is...

00:49:06.118 --> 00:49:07.748 line:93%
yours now.

00:49:10.219 --> 00:49:11.489 line:93%
You should love Cheong A...

00:49:12.759 --> 00:49:13.759 line:93%
just like...

00:49:14.259 --> 00:49:16.188 line:93%
Grandfather does.

00:49:17.129 --> 00:49:18.129 line:93%
Okay.

00:49:18.799 --> 00:49:22.029 line:93%
I'll work hard for the interests of Cheong A.

00:49:24.638 --> 00:49:26.938 line:93%
Daeil Distribution will be listed soon.

00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:30.708 line:93%
And you're the vice chairman now.

00:49:34.449 --> 00:49:36.308 line:93%
If your father was alive,

00:49:37.179 --> 00:49:38.848 line:93%
he must've been flattered.

00:49:41.819 --> 00:49:42.848 line:93%
I think so too.

00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:55.328 line:93%
Thank you.

00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:01.038 line:93%
Think about how much you want...

00:50:01.868 --> 00:50:05.109 line:93%
for the contingent fee and tell me.

00:50:06.138 --> 00:50:07.179 line:93%
Mom.

00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:10.578 line:93%
You should pay him more than what he can imagine.

00:50:11.149 --> 00:50:12.618 line:93%
I promised him.

00:50:17.819 --> 00:50:20.719 line:93%
Pil Joo, I should go to work. I have an appointment.

00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:22.159 line:93%
Okay.

00:50:33.998 --> 00:50:36.839 line:93%
Did you check up on Mo Hyun?

00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:39.208 line:93%
Yes. She's working hard...

00:50:39.478 --> 00:50:41.078 line:93%
at the welfare foundation.

00:50:41.149 --> 00:50:43.578 line:93%
She said she'd demand compensation for the arranged marriage,

00:50:44.248 --> 00:50:45.719 line:93%
but I haven't heard from her.

00:50:47.379 --> 00:50:50.819 line:93%
Whatever she does,

00:50:52.018 --> 00:50:55.359 line:93%
she makes me feel nervous.

00:51:10.768 --> 00:51:11.909 line:93%
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:51:13.409 --> 00:51:14.449 line:93%
Yes.

00:51:16.208 --> 00:51:17.679 line:93%
Yes. I'm leaving now.

00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:22.018 line:93%
Okay.

00:51:23.288 --> 00:51:24.288 line:93%
Bye.

00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:48.578 line:93%
(Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:07.098 line:93%
(Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

00:52:07.259 --> 00:52:10.469 line:93%
Vice Chairman Jang, congratulations on your promotion.

00:52:12.598 --> 00:52:13.969 line:93%
Thank you, Mr. Woo.

00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:21.808 line:93%
Thank you, Pil Joo. Thanks to you,

00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:23.509 line:93%
I could become the vice chairman.

00:52:23.978 --> 00:52:25.819 line:93%
You're ranked in second...

00:52:26.978 --> 00:52:28.918 line:93%
right after Honorary Chairman Jang.

00:52:29.449 --> 00:52:32.089 line:93%
You're the acting chairman and the vice chairman.

00:52:41.328 --> 00:52:45.638 line:93%
Then I will conduct a meeting in the chairman's office...

00:52:46.098 --> 00:52:47.498 line:93%
as the acting chairman.

00:52:54.279 --> 00:52:56.348 line:93%
I will exercise my authority over personnel affairs...

00:52:56.708 --> 00:52:58.879 line:93%
as the vice president who's won the board's approval.

00:53:03.688 --> 00:53:04.788 line:93%
Please come on in.

00:53:17.638 --> 00:53:20.638 line:93%
Congratulations on your promotion, Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon.

00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:27.978 line:93%
The first personnel appointment I announced as the vice chairman.

00:53:29.208 --> 00:53:30.449 line:93%
Vice President Jang Yeo Cheon...

00:53:31.248 --> 00:53:33.418 line:93%
is reinstated as the vice president of Cheong A Bio.

00:53:44.598 --> 00:53:45.598 line:93%
Vice Chairman Jang.

00:53:46.399 --> 00:53:50.168 line:93%
You're just like Honorary Chairman Jang who likes surprises.

00:53:50.399 --> 00:53:52.569 line:93%
I probably took it after my grandfather.

00:53:54.638 --> 00:53:55.668 line:93%
Welcome back, Yeo Cheon.

00:53:56.739 --> 00:53:59.909 line:93%
As Grandfather said, I have a lot to defend.

00:54:02.308 --> 00:54:05.018 line:93%
We should work together as a family.

00:54:08.248 --> 00:54:09.418 line:93%
Let's do as you said.

00:54:10.848 --> 00:54:12.688 line:93%
Thank you for not forgetting me.

00:54:15.159 --> 00:54:16.989 line:93%
I was waiting for the day...

00:54:17.529 --> 00:54:20.299 line:93%
to return to Korea at the lumber camp in Myanmar.

00:54:28.938 --> 00:54:29.969 line:93%
Yong Goo,

00:54:30.409 --> 00:54:33.478 line:93%
you still have the recording files from the cameras at the hospital?

00:54:33.478 --> 00:54:34.909 line:93%
Of course.

00:54:37.509 --> 00:54:39.518 line:93%
Do you want to see Mo Hyun visiting you?

00:54:39.518 --> 00:54:40.578 line:93%
No, Boo Cheon.

00:54:40.748 --> 00:54:41.848 line:93%
Boo Cheon?

00:54:44.118 --> 00:54:45.759 line:93%
I didn't pay much attention...

00:54:46.219 --> 00:54:47.688 line:93%
to Boo Cheon.

00:55:28.868 --> 00:55:29.929 line:93%
Boo Cheon...

00:55:31.138 --> 00:55:32.739 line:93%
requested your DNA test?

00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:41.078 line:93%
Becoming the chairman of Cheong A...

00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:44.819 line:93%
is neither my mom's dream...

00:55:45.348 --> 00:55:47.348 line:93%
nor your goal anymore.

00:55:48.949 --> 00:55:50.248 line:93%
Now it's my dream...

00:55:51.918 --> 00:55:53.089 line:93%
and my goal.

00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:58.129 line:93%
No matter who it is,

00:56:01.699 --> 00:56:03.299 line:93%
I won't tolerate those...

00:56:05.498 --> 00:56:07.069 line:93%
who get in my way.

00:56:39.438 --> 00:56:41.938 line:93%
It looks the same as your brother's.

00:56:42.138 --> 00:56:45.609 line:93%
This is the necklace my dad gave me.

00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:48.578 line:93%
Mo Hyun found it.

00:56:52.418 --> 00:56:53.549 line:93%
I need you to keep it well.

00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:08.058 line:93%
What brings you here at this late hour?

00:58:11.199 --> 00:58:12.659 line:93%
- Sir. - I need to talk...

00:58:13.399 --> 00:58:15.129 line:93%
to Chairman Jang urgently.

00:58:15.728 --> 00:58:18.199 line:93%
Please leave us alone.

00:58:18.998 --> 00:58:22.308 line:93%
Gosh. Is it something I'm not supposed to hear?

00:58:22.469 --> 00:58:23.569 line:93%
It is.

00:58:42.489 --> 00:58:43.759 line:93%
Attorney Kang.

00:58:44.299 --> 00:58:45.998 line:93%
What is it at this hour?

00:59:29.538 --> 00:59:30.569 line:93%
Sir.

00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:35.208 line:93%
Do you remember that necklace?

00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:38.848 line:93%
It's the necklace...

00:59:40.018 --> 00:59:42.049 line:93%
you gave to...

00:59:43.388 --> 00:59:44.719 line:93%
Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man.

00:59:47.989 --> 00:59:50.558 line:93%
Why do you have it?

01:00:13.348 --> 01:00:15.989 line:93%
I asked why you have it.

01:00:45.348 --> 01:00:46.379 line:93%
Grandfather.

01:00:54.058 --> 01:00:55.089 line:93%
Please allow me to...

01:00:56.728 --> 01:00:57.828 line:93%
make a bow to you...

01:01:01.768 --> 01:01:03.029 line:93%
as your eldest grandson, Eun Cheon.

01:02:16.868 --> 01:02:20.138 line:93%
(Money Flower)
