00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.120 line:93%
From the large lake to underground caves and a sinkhole,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.260 line:93%
Byung Man's Tribe concluded their survival in Atiu.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.530 line:93%
And the next location for survival...

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.960 line:93%
with the new Byung Man's Tribe is Aitutaki.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.330 line:93%
(Aitutaki)

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.300 line:93%
It's been voted by explorers around the world...

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.930 line:93%
as one of 1,001 sceneries to visit in your lifetime.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.500 line:93%
There are beautiful weathered volcanic rocks in Aitutaki.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.740 line:93%
3 volcanic islands and 12 coral islands...

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.880 line:93%
form a triangle in this island.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.750 line:93%
The white sand and the corals blend in with the turquoise sea,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.150 line:93%
so this place is called the last paradise on Earth.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.150 line:93%
(It's the last paradise on Earth.)

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.590 line:93%
The Law of Jungle in Cook Islands unfolds in the paradise.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.890 line:93%
The second half starts now.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.030 line:93%
(On a sunny day in Aitutaki Airport, Cook Islands)

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.770 line:93%
(Byung Man and Kang Nam await the new Tribe members.)

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.870 line:93%
This is nice.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.340 line:93%
Is that them?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.540 line:93%
(The plane cuts across the blue sky...)

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.450 line:93%
(and arrives in Aitutaki Island.)

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.830 line:93%
(The Tribe takes their first step towards a new challenge.)

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.100 line:93%
Hello.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 line:93%
Welcome to Aitutaki.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.830 line:93%
(The 34th Tribe took 34 hours to get here.)

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.240 line:93%
Welcome to Aitutaki.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.870 line:93%
It was difficult to get here, right?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.870 line:93%
(You've come a long way.)

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.310 line:93%
It was fun.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.580 line:93%
- Jung Tae. - Hello.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.640 line:93%
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.150 line:93%
- Hello. - Joon Young.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.210 line:93%
It's your third time.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.950 line:93%
Hello, I'm Actor Kim Jung Tae.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.050 line:93%

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.120 line:93%
(he played unique roles with flawless acting.)

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.760 line:93%
(He's a scene stealer who also took over variety shows.)

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.830 line:93%
I'm not too worried.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.570 line:93%
Depending on the environment,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.070 line:93%
people adapt.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.310 line:93%
(As he said,)

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.610 line:93%
(he starts surviving according to the environment.)

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.610 line:93%
Give it to me.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.950 line:93%
(He conquers the rough sea with his surviving instincts.)

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.660 line:93%
(He runs out of energy quickly too.)

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.990 line:93%
That was unexpected.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.700 line:93%
(Unlike Jung Tae,)

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.870 line:93%
(there's somebody who's full of energy.)

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.570 line:93%
You need the fishing line, right?

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.240 line:93%
(If somebody needs something,)

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.540 line:93%
(she runs with her long legs.)

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.710 line:93%
(Survival comes before the show.)

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.310 line:93%
- Be careful. - Where?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.580 line:93%
(Who is this person who runs off without the camera?)

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.190 line:93%
Hello, I'm Actress Lee Da Hee.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.360 line:93%

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.140 line:93%
(and she's here to challenge herself in the survival.)

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.340 line:93%
The other way.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.580 line:93%
(She's a perfect fit for the extreme nature of this show.)

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.550 line:93%
(As a former model,)

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.980 line:93%
(she has long legs, and she's proficient in underwater swimming.)

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.790 line:93%
Did you receive training before coming here?

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.820 line:93%
Pardon?

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.760 line:93%
I'm so shy.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.830 line:93%
It's been a while. I'm Actor Park Jung Chul.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.530 line:93%
I went to Madagascar, Nepal, Costa Rica,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.540 line:93%
Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, and the Ecuadorian Amazon.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.870 line:93%
It was Chatham.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.470 line:93%
I've gone from the sea to the mountain. Isn't that everything?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.470 line:93%
(He's a veteran who's in the jungle for the 8th time.)

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.040 line:93%
It's been 50 days since my baby was born.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.380 line:93%
I'm spending most days at home.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.520 line:93%
It's a parenting war.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.650 line:93%
I told people I'm going to the jungle,

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.260 line:93%
and they think I'm avoiding my parenting responsibilities.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.860 line:93%
I think it's also good for my baby...

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.630 line:93%
if I return home with good energy.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.500 line:93%
(Jung Joon Young's 3rd time, Niel's 2nd time)

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.240 line:93%
(Byung Chan of Victon is the youngest.)

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.740 line:93%
(The 34th Byung Man's Tribe is ready to go.)

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.380 line:93%
All right. We have to take a boat, right?

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.150 line:93%
- That's what it looks like, right? - Yes, that's what it looks like.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.550 line:93%
We are not going to the mountains.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.350 line:93%
- Right. - Should we divide ourselves?

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.290 line:93%
- I think so. - Let's do that.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.460 line:93%
This survival begins...

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.990 line:93%
as you leave the main island on the boat.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.130 line:93%
There are two boats behind you,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.300 line:93%
so please feel free to go on either one.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.600 line:93%
It's up to us?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.770 line:93%
- It's up to us? - Yes.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.870 line:93%
Let's go.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.570 line:93%
Let's get going.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.970 line:93%
- Should we go? - Let's go.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040 line:93%
What?

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.110 line:93%
(What are you doing, Byung Chan?)

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.710 line:93%
- What is it? - I...

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.980 line:93%
- got something for the Chief. - It must be something.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.010 line:93%
What?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.720 line:93%
It's for the Chief.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.720 line:93%
I have something for everybody else too.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.120 line:93%
This is the best thing with idol members.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.220 line:93%
They always bring something.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.420 line:93%
They always bring interesting items.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.990 line:93%
Take that out.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.290 line:93%
This is it.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.860 line:93%
It was on the bottom.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.430 line:93%
- It's a letter. - It's from Ha Young.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.230 line:93%
She wrote you a letter.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.470 line:93%
- Ha Young did? - Yes.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.940 line:93%
- She wrote it herself. - Really?

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.140 line:93%
- She really wrote this? - Yes.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.340 line:93%
Why did she write you a letter?

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.340 line:93%
Read it out loud.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.740 line:93%
"Hello, Chief Byung Man and the members."

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.750 line:93%
"Victon is in the same agency as us Apink."

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.850 line:93%
"I heard that Byung Chan is going to the jungle,"

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.690 line:93%
"so I thought Apink raincoats would be helpful..."

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.930 line:93%
- "when you build houses." - It was so helpful.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.830 line:93%
"I wanted to help, so I sent them through Byung Chan."

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.270 line:93%
"Please take care and don't overexert yourselves."

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.530 line:93%
"From Ha Young of Apink."

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.570 line:93%
(Ha Young's gift will be very practical for the Tribe.)

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.000 line:93%
It's pretty useful.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.310 line:93%
- Yes. - Right?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.480 line:93%
We used Apink raincoats in Fiji last time.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.980 line:93%
- Really? - Are these the same ones?

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.880 line:93%
- It's the same one. - It's for everybody?

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.350 line:93%
- Yes. - It is the same one.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.650 line:93%
Here you go.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.880 line:93%
Does Apink sell raincoats?

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.220 line:93%
- It's from our agency. - This raincoat?

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.250 line:93%
It's a promotion.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.460 line:93%
It gets cold when it rains at night.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.190 line:93%
- We'll put these to good use. - Thank you.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.730 line:93%
- Thank you. - Don't worry.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.760 line:93%
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.800 line:93%
- We're leaving. - Come this way.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.630 line:93%
Go here.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.070 line:93%
(It's up to us.)

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.470 line:93%
- Is it that important? - Pardon?

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.500 line:93%
(They get on the boats.)

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.770 line:93%
Are you going here?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.440 line:93%
- We'll go like this. - Sure.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.380 line:93%
- It doesn't matter, right? - No.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.480 line:93%
Which way are we going?

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.880 line:93%
I'll go on first.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.720 line:93%
(Byung Man, Da Hee, Jung Chul, Niel, and Byung Chan in a big boat)

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.450 line:93%
- Get on, Niel. - Okay.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.550 line:93%
Go on.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.950 line:93%
You can go first.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.790 line:93%
Go slowly.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.090 line:93%
(Jung Tae, Kang Nam, and Joon Young are in the small boat.)

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.290 line:93%
We're good to go.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.030 line:93%
(Byung Man's Tribe is ready to go.)

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.530 line:93%
See you.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.470 line:93%
(See you soon.)

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.700 line:93%
Let's go.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.480 line:93%
(They sail across the emerald sea to their survival zone.)

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.080 line:93%
Look at the color of the water.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.550 line:93%
- The color gets prettier. - This is unbelievable.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.920 line:93%
(They're amazed by the beautiful scenery.)

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.720 line:93%
- This is an art. - It looks like computer graphics.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.560 line:93%
- Right. - It's beautiful.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.820 line:93%
I've never seen this color of water.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.590 line:93%
It's kind of white too.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.530 line:93%
It's so pretty.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.870 line:93%
Look at the color of the water. It's pretty.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.600 line:93%
- How many meters is this? - I wonder.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.440 line:93%
The color doesn't look real.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.310 line:93%
Right? It's so pretty.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.840 line:93%
It looks like the color of soda.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.580 line:93%
It's beautiful.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.510 line:93%
The water is so pretty.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.280 line:93%
This place looks like Hawaii.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.150 line:93%
Look at the color of the water.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.350 line:93%
Look.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.490 line:93%
- This... - The color...

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.090 line:93%
(They can't take their eyes off from the water.)

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.100 line:93%
Hey.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.260 line:93%
(They sail alongside each other and enjoy the nature.)

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.900 line:93%
Hey! This looks like computer graphics.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.970 line:93%
It doesn't look real.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.540 line:93%
- Isn't this fake? - It looks like soda color.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.670 line:93%
The color is so pretty.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.610 line:93%
- It's so pretty. - I want to drink it.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.110 line:93%
- The color is so nice. - It's so pretty.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.550 line:93%
Is this the color of the water...

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.390 line:93%
- or the corals inside? - No.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.290 line:93%
As you get deeper,

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.330 line:93%
the water gets darker.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.500 line:93%
But it's not like the seas in Korea, right?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.930 line:93%
It's not as dark.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.670 line:93%
It's not totally dark. You can still see...

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.670 line:93%
Do you fish in specific water?

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.770 line:93%
Are most fish here edible?

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.080 line:93%
Is it okay when you're catching them? They don't bite?

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.380 line:93%
If you avoid them, they don't attack, right?

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.550 line:93%
They won't just attack you.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.120 line:93%
Sea snakes are gentle.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.150 line:93%
When do we get to go in the water?

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.190 line:93%
Have you learned to snorkel?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.160 line:93%
- Yes. - I'll guide you.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.330 line:93%
- Okay. - You can try.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.930 line:93%
- You know what? - What?

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.500 line:93%
You can drink...

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.760 line:93%
clear water like this.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.100 line:93%
I have something.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.170 line:93%
What is it?

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.430 line:93%
(He takes care of his skin.)

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.200 line:93%
It's a toner.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.210 line:93%
It brightens your skin.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.880 line:93%
The sun is strong, so you have to put something on.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.340 line:93%
True.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.510 line:93%
It's not about getting burnt. There's the volcano.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.580 line:93%
- The volcano. - That's true.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.180 line:93%
It's strong. Use a lot.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.320 line:93%
It's for everybody.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.790 line:93%
This is good.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.460 line:93%
You're too white.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.230 line:93%
I used what he gave me.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.470 line:93%
- I used everything he gave me. - It's too much.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.670 line:93%
Aren't you an actor?

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.070 line:93%
Stop trying to be funny.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.170 line:93%
I used everything he gave me.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.410 line:93%
He was being thoughtful. I don't know how I look.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.110 line:93%
It's the Kabuki style.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.110 line:93%
I'm trying to rub it.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.580 line:93%
- Is it that bad? - I'm trying,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.620 line:93%
- but it's not getting absorbed. - You have to wipe it.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.920 line:93%
Put on a play.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.250 line:93%
(The members on this boat are getting ready to survive.)

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.690 line:93%
Do it.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.190 line:93%
The color is beautiful.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.220 line:93%
It's getting prettier.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.960 line:93%
(They're absorbed in the Mother Nature.)

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.200 line:93%
- When you look from above... - This is fantastic.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.730 line:93%
It is.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.030 line:93%
Director,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.640 line:93%
when this scene airs on the television...

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.340 line:93%
(He sounds old.)

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.540 line:93%
I haven't heard "television" in a while.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.680 line:93%
Can you play "Yeonan Pier" by Kim Trio?

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:40.480 line:93%
(The boat comes by once in a while)

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.450 line:93%
You didn't drink, right?

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.450 line:93%
(Did you have a glass of rice wine?)

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.720 line:93%
(He's mesmerized by the scenery.)

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.660 line:93%
This is wonderful.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.790 line:93%
I think we're almost here.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.130 line:93%
- Cut the song. - We're here.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.830 line:93%
Our boat is going towards that island.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.940 line:93%
It's pretty.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.870 line:93%
- We're here. - It's pretty big.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.780 line:93%
(What will their survival zone be like?)

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.410 line:93%
Is it the big island? Are we headed there?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.210 line:93%
Is it the big island?

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.850 line:93%
It's so pretty.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.660 line:93%
- Is this it? - It's unbelievable.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.760 line:93%
- It's pretty. - Look at that.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000 line:93%
- Are those all coconuts? - Yes.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.170 line:93%
We won't starve to death.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.900 line:93%
(Byung Man's Tribe is motivated from the beginning.)

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.240 line:93%
- We're totally free here. - That's right.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.410 line:93%
Free?

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.680 line:93%
- I'll show you how it's done. - It's really pretty.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.280 line:93%
It's pretty.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.220 line:93%
(Kang Nam's boat gets anchored first.)

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.690 line:93%
What if...

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.950 line:93%
(The others wait on their boat.)

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.620 line:93%
Look at the waves.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.660 line:93%
This island is pretty.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:57.990 line:93%
- It's so nice. - It's small.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.030 line:93%
This is perfect for a commercial. I'm not ready.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.030 line:93%
It's a paradise. It's so nice.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.240 line:93%
- This is paradise. - Exactly.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.810 line:93%
(Byung Man scans the island from the boat.)

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.210 line:93%
These rocks...

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.720 line:93%
are from volcanic eruptions.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.250 line:93%
- These are volcanic rocks. - Right.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.320 line:93%
(Why is the other boat leaving?)

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320 line:93%
- Look at them. - Where are you going?

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.020 line:93%
(Byung Man's boat leaves the survival zone.)

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.090 line:93%
Where are you going?

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.060 line:93%
(Byung Man's boat leaves the survival zone.)

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.600 line:93%
(What's going on?)

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.800 line:93%
- Aren't we going there? - Why not?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.670 line:93%
(They're confused.)

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.340 line:93%
- What? - Hey!

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.680 line:93%
(They call out.)

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680 line:93%
What?

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.850 line:93%
(The boat sails farther away.)

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.850 line:93%
Why?

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.520 line:93%
I guess we're going to the island next to it.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.420 line:93%
- What's the idea? - What's this? Where is this going?

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.460 line:93%
(They have a bad feeling.)

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.690 line:93%
We're getting separated?

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.830 line:93%
Why are they leaving? Why aren't you telling us?

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.430 line:93%
As soon as you got on the boat,

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.740 line:93%
the upcoming 48 hours were decided.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.910 line:93%
The upcoming 48 hours were decided.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.040 line:93%
We'll keep the same members...

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.910 line:93%
For 48 hours, you have to survive together.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.980 line:93%
Here's the survival theme of Aitutaki Island.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.680 line:93%
They must survive separately for 48 hours.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.550 line:93%
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.320 line:93%
Before leaving, Byung Man's Tribe...

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.320 line:93%
got on the two boats randomly.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.220 line:93%
As soon as they got on the respective boats,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.660 line:93%
their fates for 48 hours were decided.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.860 line:93%
From now on, they'll be divided into two islands...

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.630 line:93%
of 5 and 3 people and will start their survival.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.070 line:93%
It's hard enough to try to survive together.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.410 line:93%
Will they be okay in small groups?

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.810 line:93%
- Hold on. - I got on the wrong boat.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.880 line:93%
(They regret it. Their future is bleak.)

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.280 line:93%
I should have gotten on the other one.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.650 line:93%
- Seriously, what's going on? - Wait. Don't these islands connect?

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.750 line:93%
I knew I got on the wrong one.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.460 line:93%
It was totally random.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.630 line:93%
Why did I get on the boat without Byung Man?

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.460 line:93%
I regret it.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.500 line:93%
Is this for real?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.500 line:93%
(They're confused as well.)

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.730 line:93%
- Really? - Are we doing this?

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.770 line:93%
- For two days? - Yes.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.370 line:93%
I was more worried about Kang Nam's side than ours.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.270 line:93%
There were five of us,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.510 line:93%
but they only had three.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.650 line:93%
Are we going to be separated for 48 hours?

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.720 line:93%
(They're at a loss.)

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.350 line:93%
What? What is this?

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.890 line:93%
48 hours is more than half of the trip.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.220 line:93%
- Really? - The three of them?

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.360 line:93%
And us?

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.130 line:93%
(They're more serious.)

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.530 line:93%
Wait. Don't these islands connect?

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.900 line:93%
(They're only 800m apart, but the water is in the way.)

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.600 line:93%
- Once the tide is low? - We can swim there.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.440 line:93%
- We can't have crayfish then. - What? By ourselves?

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.510 line:93%
(They're worried about the meal.)

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.270 line:93%
How are we supposed to survive?

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.210 line:93%
I haven't been here in a while, and this is the worst.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:06.010 line:93%
(Can they survive without the Chief?)

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.120 line:93%
The color changed. It's different from earlier.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.490 line:93%
I can see the bottom. Right?

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.790 line:93%
- It's different. - Look.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.820 line:93%
(He scans the area before getting off.)

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.130 line:93%
The coconuts are too high.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.690 line:93%
- That's true. - They're too high.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.730 line:93%
There's a lower one.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.660 line:93%
That one?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.170 line:93%
They arrive on the two islands with the goal of...

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.770 line:93%
surviving separately for 48 hours.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.840 line:93%
How will they survive on the two islands...

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.940 line:93%
that look close but far.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.080 line:93%
(Niel is the first one to get off the boat on Byung Man's side.)

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.080 line:93%
- Hold on, Niel. - Yes.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.550 line:93%
- Did you take it? - What?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.620 line:93%
Excuse me.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.290 line:93%
- Oh, this? - Yes.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.420 line:93%
- This... - Don't go too fast.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.890 line:93%
I'm going to drop it.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.460 line:93%
- You have to take care of me. - I know.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.460 line:93%
- That's good. - Okay.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.030 line:93%
I didn't get my shoes wet.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.210 line:93%
(Byung Chan gets off next.)

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.470 line:93%
Da Hee, can you take my bag and jacket?

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.580 line:93%
Okay.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.980 line:93%
(He takes care of Jung Chul.)

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.950 line:93%
You're taking care of an old guy. You're giving me a piggyback,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.280 line:93%
so I might get criticized.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.420 line:93%
It's comfortable though.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.090 line:93%
Thank you.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.260 line:93%
(He piggybacks Da Hee as well.)

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.600 line:93%
Byung Chan is a man.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.660 line:93%
(Byung Chan is a real man.)

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.070 line:93%
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.100 line:93%
- I'll take your bag. - It's okay.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.100 line:93%
You're the best.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.740 line:93%
Let's get there first.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.270 line:93%
Are we going to be here for two days?

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.810 line:93%
The most important thing is to look for a site for our shelter.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.350 line:93%
That's right. Let's take a tour of the island.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.350 line:93%
I think it'll take 9 minutes and 8 seconds.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.250 line:93%
- 9 minutes and 8 seconds? - The island is really small.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.420 line:93%
I like how small the island was.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.790 line:93%
Compared to big islands, smaller islands...

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.490 line:93%
have less bugs,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.490 line:93%
and it's airy.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.560 line:93%
(It's a small island that feels pleasant.)

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.260 line:93%
When we first got there, the sun was really strong,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.770 line:93%
so I really liked it.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.400 line:93%
The weather was great,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.800 line:93%
so it was pretty.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.970 line:93%
The sand portion was long,

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.110 line:93%
and there was the forest.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.380 line:93%
It felt like there will be a lot of food,

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.710 line:93%
and it looked like a good place to be in.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.780 line:93%
The fact that I was in the same team...

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.390 line:93%
as Byung Man took all my worries away.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.290 line:93%
I didn't think it'll be hard.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.260 line:93%
We've never been separated from the first day.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.320 line:93%
The first thing...

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.690 line:93%
that popped up in my head was that I'll have to work hard.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.730 line:93%
Let's leave our bags here...

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.960 line:93%
and look around.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.030 line:93%
Let's look around.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.570 line:93%
Hey, look.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.440 line:93%
- They have that. - What is that?

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.710 line:93%
It's a table.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.840 line:93%
There's a table.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.580 line:93%
Areas like these...

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.410 line:93%
They have this in Belize.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.450 line:93%
During certain seasons, fishermen come...

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.720 line:93%
and leave after they're done.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.890 line:93%
They come during seasons to catch fish.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.550 line:93%
That's what that is.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.690 line:93%
That's why the trees are cut.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.760 line:93%
(Locals rest or stay here after fishing in the area.)

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.290 line:93%
That's right. It's a perfect size.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.500 line:93%
- Shall we go that way? - Okay.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.400 line:93%
The island you see in front of you...

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.670 line:93%
is the island Kang Nam and the other two are at.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.970 line:93%
- That island? - Yes.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.870 line:93%
(They can clearly see it.)

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.780 line:93%
- Are we going to see them? - We'll see them on the last day.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.210 line:93%
- 48 hours is 2 days. - We'll meet on the 3rd day.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.410 line:93%
- We'll meet on the 3rd day. - Right.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.550 line:93%
Can we swim there? Can't we do that?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.620 line:93%
If you'd like, you can.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.350 line:93%
You're saying we can swim there, right?

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.390 line:93%
Yes.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.690 line:93%
- She's saying it's possible. - She's so strong.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.890 line:93%
It's different once you put the flippers on.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.760 line:93%
This is nice.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.200 line:93%
We can...

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.800 line:93%
- use this as a table. - We can.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.440 line:93%
That's true. People stayed here temporarily.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.840 line:93%
There's another one.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840 line:93%
(There's a pillar made out of palm tree as well.)

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.410 line:93%
We can use the pillar.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.510 line:93%
(They have all the ingredients to build a jungle house.)

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.050 line:93%
I have to map it out in my head...

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.220 line:93%
so that I know how to use the ingredients.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.620 line:93%
I'll think of a plan,

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.290 line:93%
so you can partner up and take a tour.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.960 line:93%
If there's somewhere you can go in, try it.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.460 line:93%
- Take a full tour. - Okay.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.960 line:93%
Shouldn't we take tools?

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.830 line:93%
Tools? What do we have?

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.500 line:93%
- I think we should take them. - Okay.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.540 line:93%
(She opens up her backpack.)

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.210 line:93%
Da Hee is the most prepared.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.470 line:93%
She has good tools.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.640 line:93%
Hold on. What's this?

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.580 line:93%
Before I came here, I bought all these.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.420 line:93%
If I try to take professional tools,

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.490 line:93%
you might stop me,

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.260 line:93%
so I took items that are used daily.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.390 line:93%
For example, I can use mesh laundry bags as nets.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.430 line:93%
I thought long and hard about what to bring.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.800 line:93%
We have to catch fish,

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.440 line:93%
so I prepared mesh laundry bags to use as nets.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.270 line:93%
I don't like bugs,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.110 line:93%
so when I sleep,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.510 line:93%
I can put it over my head.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.350 line:93%
Byung Man can use these skewers...

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.380 line:93%
as harpoons when he goes night hunting.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.180 line:93%
Do you want to come?

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.020 line:93%
I put a sticker on him.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.260 line:93%
The Law of Jungle.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.060 line:93%
I brought this. It was so memorable.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.100 line:93%
I brought wires to make a grill.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.670 line:93%
(She's the best.)

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.500 line:93%
We have to catch fish.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.940 line:93%
I'll catch fish at all cost.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.340 line:93%
All right.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.040 line:93%
(Wire, string, nails, hammer, plier, and so on)

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.210 line:93%
Da Hee brought everything.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.280 line:93%
- Gloves. - This is a hardware store.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.080 line:93%
Gloves.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.680 line:93%
- A grater? - Last time,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.920 line:93%
you grated coconut.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.060 line:93%
You made holes in a canteen, but you're not in a good condition,

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.420 line:93%
so this is for you.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.520 line:93%
- Really? - Yes.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.860 line:93%
I have to climb and get coconuts then.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.530 line:93%
- Right? - It's a gift for your return.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.060 line:93%
This is awesome.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.840 line:93%
She really wanted to be here.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.640 line:93%
She prepared a lot.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.880 line:93%
Even men don't prepare that much.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.280 line:93%
The fact that she brought survival tools...

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.080 line:93%
was impressive.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.280 line:93%
You prepared so much. You're so detailed.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.280 line:93%
You're so detailed.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.790 line:93%
Next, Niel.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.290 line:93%
(Show me what you brought.)

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.360 line:93%
(Me?)

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.760 line:93%
(They saw what Da Hee brought.)

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.030 line:93%
What did you bring?

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.500 line:93%
I didn't bring anything special.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.630 line:93%
Just this.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.800 line:93%
(He brought a finger heart.)

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.410 line:93%
(This is how I consider you.)

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.570 line:93%
Is this what you brought?

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.280 line:93%
Keep it in a safe place. Take it back.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.350 line:93%
Okay.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.410 line:93%
- I'll put it back. - Jung Chul.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.250 line:93%
It's down here.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.750 line:93%
It's big.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.290 line:93%
(He makes a heart with both hands.)

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.620 line:93%
- It's big. - It is.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.720 line:93%
You got a big one.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.720 line:93%
- What about you? - Byung Chan.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.290 line:93%
It's in my bag.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.490 line:93%
- Your bag? - Good.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.600 line:93%
This is not free.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.030 line:93%
(It's a heart.)

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.100 line:93%
It's the biggest.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.570 line:93%
Cut it up. Let's use it for hunting.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.340 line:93%
- Cut it up. - Leave it that way.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.670 line:93%
- Leave it as it is. - Okay.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:09.870 line:93%
Put it back.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.940 line:93%
(Team Byung Man has more love than tools.)

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.340 line:93%
Imagine if Da Hee wasn't on our side.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.710 line:93%
- She saved us. - Thank you.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.780 line:93%
- I knew it. - Thank you.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.480 line:93%
- It's nothing. - It's Never Da Hee.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.650 line:93%
We won't die because of this.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.020 line:93%
(We won't die because we have Da Hee.)

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.520 line:93%
- That's her nickname. - Okay.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.290 line:93%
- Look around. - Okay. See you later.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.490 line:93%
(Team Byung Man explores around.)

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.460 line:93%
Look in the water too.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.130 line:93%
There might be clams.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.100 line:93%
- Take a full loop. - Okay.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.400 line:93%
They're there.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.530 line:93%
- Who is? - Don't you see them?

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.740 line:93%
The other team?

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.910 line:93%
- Is Jung Tae there? - Yes.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:44.910 line:93%
(They can see the other members far away.)

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.010 line:93%
They look close,

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.780 line:93%
but if we try to swim over, it'll take a long time.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.320 line:93%
It looks close.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720 line:93%
(The two islands are 800m apart.)

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.750 line:93%
It'll take longer than you think. The current is strong.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.920 line:93%
(It won't be easy because of the waves.)

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.450 line:93%
It's hard. It looks hard.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.890 line:93%
(They turn away from the other members...)

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.130 line:93%
(and focus on searching nearby.)

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.570 line:93%
- My gosh. - Why? My gosh, gloves.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.170 line:93%
(It's a moray eel.)

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.500 line:93%
- No. - Can't we catch it?

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.210 line:93%
We can catch it.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.670 line:93%
- I saw it last time. - We can catch it,

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.040 line:93%
- but it doesn't taste good. - It has many bones, right?

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.480 line:93%
- It's a moray eel. - Hey.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.950 line:93%
- It's a moray eel. - You're incredible.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.120 line:93%
I couldn't remember the name,

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.920 line:93%
so I was just pointing at it. You're incredible.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.420 line:93%
It's hard to catch, and it tastes bad.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.920 line:93%
- It tastes bad, and it's bony. - Yes, it has many bones.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.590 line:93%
- What is it? - It's a net.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.930 line:93%
- Where? - Here.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.430 line:93%
There's a net.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.930 line:93%
We can use that later, right?

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.170 line:93%
Right. We can use anything that's here.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.000 line:93%
Let's just remember where it is.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.300 line:93%
You see the rocky areas?

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.740 line:93%
- The rocks. In between the rocks. - Right.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.540 line:93%
There are fish in these areas.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.680 line:93%
Jung Chul, isn't this a fish?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.450 line:93%
- Where? - Jung Chul.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.550 line:93%
(Did she find a fish?)

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.720 line:93%
- This one. The one on the bottom. - Where?

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.860 line:93%
- It looks weird. - Where?

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.290 line:93%
The one on the bottom.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.590 line:93%
Look at the tail. It's moving.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.890 line:93%
It's not a fish.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.660 line:93%
Isn't it a sea cucumber?

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.500 line:93%
There's a conch.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.470 line:93%
Hold on. That's not important right now.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.170 line:93%
We'll miss this one then.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.640 line:93%
I know, but this is a sea cucumber.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.410 line:93%
It's not a sea cucumber. It's a fish.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.510 line:93%
It's not.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.380 line:93%
I'm sure.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.210 line:93%
- Didn't you bring that? - It's not.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.280 line:93%
Did you bring the skewer?

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.950 line:93%
This is my eighth time here.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.850 line:93%
- I brought it. - It's not a fish.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.950 line:93%
You picked them up. I just brought them.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.390 line:93%
Which one?

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.990 line:93%
The skewer. We can use it as a harpoon.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.090 line:93%
I thought you took everything we needed.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.190 line:93%
I only brought this.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.900 line:93%
- I packed these. - I know.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.560 line:93%
- What about you? - We each had to bring it?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.470 line:93%
I didn't bring anything.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:51.770 line:93%
(I came empty-handed.)

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.140 line:93%
I didn't bring anything.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.000 line:93%
We're just exploring.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.670 line:93%
I see the conch.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.910 line:93%
It's not a fish. I'm serious.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.480 line:93%
You're wrong. It is a fish.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.810 line:93%
Go towards it.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.950 line:93%
Try it then.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.520 line:93%
- It looks gross. - It's trial and error.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.050 line:93%
Jung Chul, do you want to try it?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.220 line:93%
What? Do you want me to take it out?

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.360 line:93%
Yes.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.760 line:93%
Can you do it?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.760 line:93%
I thought you were confident.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.030 line:93%
I saw it move.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.100 line:93%
(Jung Chul takes over.)

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.930 line:93%
Is it a snake?

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.270 line:93%
It's not moving.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.110 line:93%
(What are you?)

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.110 line:93%
Is it moving?

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.480 line:93%
It's defending itself.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.480 line:93%
(It spurts out white liquid.)

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480 line:93%
It's spurting out.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.250 line:93%
(Oh, my)

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.750 line:93%
See?

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.790 line:93%
- This... - Good job moving it.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.020 line:93%
(She's scared,)

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.090 line:93%
(but she doesn't forget to praise him.)

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.490 line:93%
- Can you move it up more? - Thanks for your compliment.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.330 line:93%
- A little bit more. - Should I move it up more?

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.100 line:93%
- Yes. - Okay.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.400 line:93%
She was making me do it.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.170 line:93%
I didn't feel bad.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.100 line:93%
She was very enthusiastic.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.000 line:93%
She wanted to help.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.670 line:93%
She tried to participate.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.080 line:93%
I was thankful.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.350 line:93%
I have seen something like this.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.510 line:93%
It has a name.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.850 line:93%
- It isn't fish. - I told you it isn't fish.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.950 line:93%
Fish doesn't look like that.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.720 line:93%
Go in.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.820 line:93%
- There is a conch. - I told you earlier.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.030 line:93%
There is a big one.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.200 line:93%
- I told you. - There is another one.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200 line:93%
I told you.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.770 line:93%
Take off the stone and put it here.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:32.770 line:93%
There is another one.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.000 line:93%
There are no small ones.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.240 line:93%
- Okay. - There are many of them.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.380 line:93%
(She becomes absorbed in collecting conchs.)

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.810 line:93%
Collect a few of them.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.210 line:93%
- Is this edible? - It's edible.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.380 line:93%
(Taking off)

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.220 line:93%
It's tasty when it's grilled.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.490 line:93%
- It's a conch. - A conch?

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.660 line:93%
There are clams too.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.090 line:93%
Let's take them.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.360 line:93%
- Give them to me. - Are they too small?

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.460 line:93%
Give them to me.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.930 line:93%
- Feel them. - I don't need to.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.230 line:93%
There is no flesh.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.330 line:93%
The shells opened.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.730 line:93%
(He has nothing to say.)

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:05.770 line:93%
My goodness.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.270 line:93%
Do you want to carry it?

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.470 line:93%
- The bag? - Yes.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.670 line:93%
Okay. I will carry it.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:12.770 line:93%
(She makes a bag for the jungle.)

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.880 line:93%
There are plenty to eat.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.980 line:93%
We should catch fish.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.250 line:93%
We should.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.780 line:93%
We will probably go on a hunt after sunset.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.420 line:93%
It's not strong on the details,

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.920 line:93%
but I need to collect conchs.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.660 line:93%
- Do what you can do. - Carry it.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.230 line:93%
Just make it possible for me to carry it.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.200 line:93%
Make it a cross body bag.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.030 line:93%
You can zip and unzip.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.030 line:93%
(Da Hee makes use of the laundry bag.)

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.670 line:93%
We don't have much time.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.570 line:93%
- We need to move fast. - It's okay.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.370 line:93%
Relax.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.480 line:93%
Survival doesn't get easier.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.950 line:93%
Relax even if you are in a hurry.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.580 line:93%
There are too many of them.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.180 line:93%
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.890 line:93%
- Jung Chul. - We have enough.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.050 line:93%
Be careful.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.720 line:93%
- Are you okay? - Why do you ask?

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160 line:93%
(Jung Chul looks for wounds.)

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.930 line:93%
You aren't hurt, are you? You need to be careful.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.700 line:93%
- Step on the floor. - I am embarrassed. Stop talking.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.300 line:93%
Okay.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.500 line:93%
Here.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.340 line:93%
(She collects conchs as if nothing happened.)

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.410 line:93%
It's slippery. Don't step on the wet rocks.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.840 line:93%
Let's see what Chief Byung Man is doing.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.350 line:93%
It hurts.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.350 line:93%
(My tailbone hurts.)

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.780 line:93%
Are we on our own?

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.790 line:93%
(The three members are left in a different island.)

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.620 line:93%
(Dazed)

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.390 line:93%
(How will we live?)

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.660 line:93%
(They are at a loss.)

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.160 line:93%
(I am going back home.)

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.230 line:93%
Hold on. Where are you going?

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:44.570 line:93%
Come on.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:45.870 line:93%
Where are you going?

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.740 line:93%
He really tried to leave.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.240 line:93%
This is the worst scenario.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240 line:93%
(You said this place is the last paradise on Earth.)

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.340 line:93%
Hold on. You must be good at things.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.310 line:93%
I can't do anything without Byung Man.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.750 line:93%
- We have no time to complain. - Okay.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.350 line:93%
Let's unpack and get ready.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.290 line:93%
- You are optimistic. - Why are you so optimistic?

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.990 line:93%
- What? - Why are you so optimistic?

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.860 line:93%
I am a married man.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.560 line:93%
Are you optimistic because you are married?

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.760 line:93%
That's convincing.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.060 line:93%
Let's go over there.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.700 line:93%
Then we should decide...

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:22.640 line:93%
which place will be our base camp.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:23.970 line:93%
It can be here.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.570 line:93%
- What? - This place is good.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.980 line:93%
This island is small.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.740 line:93%
Water probably flows underneath.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880 line:93%
Shall we go around the island?

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.880 line:93%
Let's put our luggage here and explore the island.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.150 line:93%
- Wouldn't it be better? - Shall we go around the island?

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.290 line:93%
Let's put our luggage here and explore the island.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.160 line:93%
- It will be a walk. - Shall we do that?

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.020 line:93%
Shall we meet back here?

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.660 line:93%
What? Should we go separately?

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.230 line:93%
You won't have enough screen time unless you go with me.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.460 line:93%
All right.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.470 line:93%
Bye.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.770 line:93%
(The exploration starts.)

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.070 line:93%
It's hard to go into the forest, right?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.970 line:93%
(Right next to the beach is a dense jungle.)

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.970 line:93%
I can hear the birds.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.110 line:93%
There is an orangutan.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.110 line:93%
- Really? - Yes.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.680 line:93%
(What?)

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.110 line:93%
Will you keep telling these lies?

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.310 line:93%
- What is this? - I have to tell them at first.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.520 line:93%
- You have to tell them at first. - Otherwise, I feel awkward.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.420 line:93%
All right.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.690 line:93%
Can you light up a fire?

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.690 line:93%
- What? - Can you light up a fire?

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.190 line:93%
You should light up your eyes.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.860 line:93%
- Let's go around the island. - Okay.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.130 line:93%
I am sorry that I can't react to all of your jokes.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.830 line:93%
I will react to 2 out of 3 jokes.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.500 line:93%
- I will react to 2 out of 3 jokes. - Joon Young.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.100 line:93%
- Yes? - Try to be more responsive.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.040 line:93%
We have only met.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.470 line:93%
As a fellow celebrity,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.070 line:93%
- you can be more understanding. - Of course.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.380 line:93%
Kang Nam, lead the way.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.380 line:93%
Okay.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.980 line:93%
(With Kang Nam leading, they walk into the forest.)

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.380 line:93%
(It's completely different from the beach.)

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.520 line:93%
Kang Nam. What will we do without Byung Man?

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.720 line:93%
We don't have a shelter. How will we build a shelter?

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.390 line:93%
There will be mosquitoes.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.260 line:93%
There is no wind to chase them away. This is a disaster.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.030 line:93%
- I feel dizzy. - Hold on.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.800 line:93%
There is a bird.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.970 line:93%
Isn't it a parrot?

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.200 line:93%
Why is it sitting down?

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.570 line:93%
(It's a bird with white weathers and a dark beak.)

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.210 line:93%
There is another one.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.110 line:93%
This one has a room on the second floor.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.510 line:93%
- It's pretty. - Isn't it more expensive?

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.150 line:93%
- What do you mean? - Isn't this room more expensive?

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.620 line:93%
The second floor is more expensive.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.790 line:93%
(White tern is well-known to live for many years.)

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.390 line:93%
Its beak is blue.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.960 line:93%
(We have a nest. Do you have a shelter?)

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.860 line:93%
(They cross the forest that is filled with birds...)

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.070 line:93%
(and reach to the beach on the other side.)

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.830 line:93%
- We reached the other side. - What?

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.970 line:93%
We reached the other side.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.840 line:93%
(They travel far to find a place to build their shelter.)

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.870 line:93%
Is this side better?

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.270 line:93%
This side could be better.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.740 line:93%
The wind will keep the mosquitoes away.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.310 line:93%
If we sleep over there, the mosquitoes will bite us.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.610 line:93%
The water won't come up to here, will it?

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.680 line:93%
If it's too windy,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.680 line:93%
- won't it get too cold? - What about the water?

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.790 line:93%
The beach on the other side was wider.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.490 line:93%
- Let's walk around. - Shall we do that?

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:52.490 line:93%
Let's walk around.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.720 line:93%
- Let's walk around some more. - This drives me crazy.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.460 line:93%
We were in the jungle, but it's different by the beach.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.900 line:93%
There must be a volcano.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200 line:93%
A volcano.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.370 line:93%
(The topography is varied even though the island is small.)

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.370 line:93%
(Is there something to eat?)

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.270 line:93%
There are no clams.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.970 line:93%
(They can't even find clams.)

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.750 line:93%
Isn't that a giant clam?

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.580 line:93%
Oh, it isn't. What is that?

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.850 line:93%
Isn't that a giant clam?

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.960 line:93%
(Sharp needles)

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.160 line:93%
Isn't it a porcupine carcass?

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.990 line:93%
I found a monster.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.330 line:93%
What? Is it an animal?

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.360 line:93%
What is that?

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.100 line:93%
Isn't it an ammonite fossil?

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.140 line:93%
What is that?

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.670 line:93%
(They take a closer look.)

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.670 line:93%
Blowfish.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.270 line:93%
Blowfish.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.080 line:93%
- What's that? - Blowfish.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.680 line:93%
What's that?

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.650 line:93%
- Blowfish. - It's poisonous.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.450 line:93%
- Blowfish. - Yes.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.320 line:93%
- It's fish. - Yes.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.590 line:93%
That's why it smells.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.760 line:93%
- It's smelly. - It's smelly.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.660 line:93%
There is a crab. Is it alive?

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:06.230 line:93%
I think it's dead.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.360 line:93%
(This one is dead too.)

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.900 line:93%
It's dead. It's like a fossil.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.030 line:93%
(In this island,)

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.030 line:93%
It's a crab.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:15.470 line:93%
(nothing is alive.)

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.670 line:93%
No way.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.680 line:93%
- Is it a shark? - It's so big.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.740 line:93%
(There is a giant fish bone.)

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.250 line:93%
It will be nice to catch fish this big.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.480 line:93%
Isn't it a tuna?

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.580 line:93%
(Why is it on the beach?)

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.790 line:93%
- It must have been this big. - It's really big.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.090 line:93%
(Without Chief Byung Man,)

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.660 line:93%
(they feel a sense of fear.)

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.960 line:93%
This drives me crazy.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.830 line:93%
There is nothing on this island.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.330 line:93%
What should we do?

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.270 line:93%
There is nothing on this island.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.270 line:93%
(Will the three of them be able to survive?)

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.870 line:93%
(Meanwhile, on the island with Chief Byung Man,)

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.280 line:93%
(he is planning a jungle house on his own.)

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.380 line:93%
It will get colder at night.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.060 line:93%
(An hour ago)

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.360 line:93%
I went inside the forest.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.730 line:93%
There were sand flies and mosquitoes.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.300 line:93%
I smell chicken poop.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.300 line:93%
(Is there chicken here?)

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.440 line:93%
That's why I decided to move to the beach.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.380 line:93%
(Build a shelter on the windy beach.)

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.380 line:93%
(He is planning to build a shelter on the beach.)

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.520 line:93%
I will focus on making it waterproof...

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.350 line:93%
so that we don't get rained on.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.830 line:93%
(Byung Man figured out the environment upon arrival.)

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.100 line:93%
Squalls can come suddenly.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.140 line:93%
(It's know-how that stems from experiences and knowledge.)

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:55.440 line:93%
It rains mostly at night.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.310 line:93%
That's why we need a roof.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.410 line:93%
Look over there.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:06.480 line:93%
(Build a roof over the shelter at a humid island.)

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:13.260 line:93%
(He decided on the location and design.)

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.760 line:93%
(Use materials from the environment.)

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.670 line:93%
(He will use the remains of the resting place.)

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.370 line:93%
Hurry up.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.870 line:93%
Hurry up.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.470 line:93%
Did you catch something?

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.610 line:93%
(Jung Chul and Da Hee come back with conchs.)

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.810 line:93%
Conchs.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.180 line:93%
- What? - We collected conchs.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.410 line:93%
Conchs?

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.580 line:93%
(They have a lot of conchs.)

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.850 line:93%
This is...

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.320 line:93%
- Did you find these? - There are a lot of them.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.450 line:93%
There were a lot of them in this size.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.990 line:93%
We only collected a few.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.390 line:93%
Murex is very tasty.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.660 line:93%
- Is it tasty? - Yes.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.260 line:93%
I didn't think it would be tasty as there were so many of them.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.660 line:93%
There were a lot of them.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.230 line:93%
That's why you said you collected them.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.360 line:93%
- We collected them. - You collected them.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.470 line:93%
That's right.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.970 line:93%
My goodness.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.370 line:93%
We can collect these...

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.340 line:93%
- and catch fish. - She wants fish.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.840 line:93%
Then let's store them...

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.550 line:93%
somewhere else.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.020 line:93%
- Let's put them there. - There?

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.150 line:93%
- You see the rocks, right? - Is that the storage?

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.120 line:93%
Yes. Put them there.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.650 line:93%
- We could farm them. - Keep them in clear water.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.560 line:93%
We can have these for snacks.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.830 line:93%
(Da Hee stores what she collected.)

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.330 line:93%
Keep them submerged in water.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.500 line:93%
(She can do it well on her own.)

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.910 line:93%
(They now have food in the natural storage.)

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.410 line:93%
Jung Chul, let's build a house.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.020 line:93%
-You see the big logs, right? - Yes.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.020 line:93%
We will put the thickest ones sideways.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.720 line:93%
- You will lay them down. - Two logs will enough.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.090 line:93%
- Then we will lay them like this. - Three logs.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.860 line:93%
There are two sheets plywood.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.760 line:93%
We can put them over the logs.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.630 line:93%
- The roof will be triangular. - It will look like this.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.230 line:93%
It will keep the rain out.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.300 line:93%
- The end. - The end.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.540 line:93%
- Jung Chul. - Yes?

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.340 line:93%
(Byung Man hasn't recovered fully.)

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.210 line:93%
- This one and this one. - We need all of them.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.310 line:93%
- Shall I take all of them? - Yes.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.240 line:93%
(He moves the logs under Chief Byung Man's directions.)

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.340 line:93%
Move them over there.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.410 line:93%
(He moves the logs under Chief Byung Man's directions.)

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.390 line:93%
I lost the muscles I made in The Law of Jungle.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.960 line:93%
(Even for a veteran, the logs are heavy.)

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.060 line:93%
(At that moment)

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.770 line:93%
Da Hee, please take this one. Watch the nails.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.500 line:93%
This one.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.840 line:93%
(She carries it slowly at first.)

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.610 line:93%
(Then she sprints.)

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.650 line:93%
(Da Hee sprints across the beach.)

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.850 line:93%
(Running)

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.150 line:93%
(Heave-ho)

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.560 line:93%
(She runs back as soon as she puts the log down.)

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.230 line:93%
(Da Hee is an energetic woman who roams the jungle.)

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.900 line:93%
(Da Hee never runs out of energy.)

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.800 line:93%
You can put it in the middle.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.640 line:93%
(The veteran ran out of energy.)

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.580 line:93%
(Running)

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.420 line:93%
(She is scary.)

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.620 line:93%
(Cheerful)

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.260 line:93%
(Grabbing)

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.560 line:93%
(Da Hee contributes a lot.)

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.730 line:93%
We just need to bring the big log.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.330 line:93%
Is it over there?

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.930 line:93%
- Yes. - The big one's heavy.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.600 line:93%
- I have you. - Let's carry it together.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.870 line:93%
(Let's carry the log together.)

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.470 line:93%
I can't carry it alone.

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:52.840 line:93%
It has been a while...

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.910 line:93%
(He needs Da Hee's strength to carry the log.)

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.040 line:93%
since I carried the log.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040 line:93%
(He needs Da Hee's strength to carry the log.)

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.180 line:93%
(However, she organizes her backpack.)

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.350 line:93%
You have everything in your backpack.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.510 line:93%
(However, she organizes her backpack.)

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.150 line:93%
It's a backpack of treasures.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.490 line:93%
(A rope?)

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.920 line:93%
- Now... - You put it under the log.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.190 line:93%
(They put the rope under the log.)

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.430 line:93%
- We can carry it like this. - You are smart.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.790 line:93%
All right.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.930 line:93%
It's much easier.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.470 line:93%
You are the brain of the team.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.140 line:93%
(Da Hee is strong and smart.)

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.310 line:93%
You are so smart.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.040 line:93%
I am so impressed.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.610 line:93%
Da Hee, please bring an ax.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.450 line:93%
Make a shape of V.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.650 line:93%
(Even for the veterans, axing isn't easy.)

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.720 line:93%
You should try everything.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.230 line:93%
(She takes the ax with wide eyes.)

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:45.630 line:93%
I trust you more than Jung Chul.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:48.630 line:93%
I bet she can do it better than me.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.630 line:93%
That's right. Use the weight of the ax.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:52.630 line:93%
She knows how to use an ax.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.110 line:93%
She has the know-how.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.510 line:93%
We should check how much Da Hee moves in a day.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.780 line:93%
We need to cut a furrow.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.790 line:93%
(She follows Byung Man's instructions.)

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.190 line:93%
She has the know-how.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.260 line:93%
(1,000,001, 1,000,002)

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.390 line:93%
(1,000,003)

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.860 line:93%
That's enough. That's perfect.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.230 line:93%
(She cut a furrow neatly.)

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.130 line:93%
All right.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.640 line:93%
We need to dig a hole.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.600 line:93%
- The lower one. - This log.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.670 line:93%
(She picks up the tool...)

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:37.510 line:93%
(and digs the earth without a word.)

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.620 line:93%
(Staring)

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.420 line:93%
She is better than most men.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.830 line:93%
I saw her run around. She was incredibly active.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.500 line:93%
"She really wanted to be on The Law of Jungle."

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.070 line:93%
(She moves endlessly despite the heat.)

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.040 line:93%
It was hard to work because of the heat.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.810 line:93%
However, my body felt great despite the exhaustion.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.940 line:93%
I didn't think of it as a struggle.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.550 line:93%
(She is 100-percent suited for The Law of Jungle.)

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.620 line:93%
(Thanks to Da Hee, the foundation is complete.)

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.320 line:93%
- Don't you need a furrow there? - No.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.750 line:93%
Why aren't they coming?

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.750 line:93%
(Where are the younger members?)

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.160 line:93%
(Coming soon)

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.130 line:93%
(In one island are careful plans for survival.)

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.530 line:93%
(In the other is a free-spirited survival.)

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.850 line:93%
(They haven't decided where to build a house.)

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:36.950 line:93%
We need to build a house.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.770 line:93%
(They circled the island.)

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.910 line:93%
(What should I do?)

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.680 line:93%
There is nothing.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.990 line:93%
(They go back to the starting point.)

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.290 line:93%
This place is nice.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.930 line:93%
- Where? - This place is nice.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.150 line:93%
Look.

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.080 line:93%
- The grass tells us... - You are right.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.650 line:93%
- the water won't reach this far. - This place is nice.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:04.390 line:93%
We won't need a roof.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.490 line:93%
(A coconut tree provides the shade.)

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.490 line:93%
Now, let's make this place our base camp.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.730 line:93%
We can't sleep like this.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.870 line:93%
- What do you mean? - I mean...

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.100 line:93%
- It might rain. - That's right.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.370 line:93%
We have raincoats.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.800 line:93%
(We have Apink raincoats.)

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.870 line:93%
We can put them together.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.840 line:93%
I have three raincoats.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.440 line:93%
Let's put up the raincoats...

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.550 line:93%
with a rope.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.420 line:93%
It will bump up the cost of the house.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.350 line:93%
- We can use a rope. - This place isn't developed.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.950 line:93%
- Is it cheap? - It's cheap.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:35.990 line:93%
I see.

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:39.190 line:93%
The mountain and the sea create the perfect harmony.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.130 line:93%
You always have a response.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.330 line:93%
That's right.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.860 line:93%
You weren't a comedian, were you?

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.360 line:93%
- What? - You have always been an actor.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.000 line:93%
- I was a resident of Busan. - A resident of Busan.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.140 line:93%
(He makes a dad joke all the time.)

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.570 line:93%
Let's use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.670 line:93%
- Pythagoras? - What?

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.170 line:93%
- Why did you bring up Pythagoras? - It's a triangle.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.780 line:93%
It's mathematics, right?

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.840 line:93%
X minus Y multiplied by X.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.050 line:93%
- You are X. - Really?

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.750 line:93%
- You are X. - I like Y.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.450 line:93%
My goodness.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.850 line:93%
(They're really amazing.)

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.950 line:93%
- My goodness. - Do you know pi? 3.14.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.290 line:93%
Do you know pi? 3.14.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.820 line:93%
Walnut pie is the best.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.290 line:93%
(I haven't struggled this much in The Law of Jungle.)

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.330 line:93%
Now...

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.500 line:93%
Let's build a big house.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.870 line:93%
- Let's make a triangle. - A triangle.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.340 line:93%
Everyone,

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.240 line:93%
I brought this to repel mosquitoes.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.270 line:93%
(He brought it from Korea to avoid the mosquitoes.)

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.540 line:93%
Thank you.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.440 line:93%
(Jung Tae takes care of the younger members.)

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.580 line:93%
You must protect your legs too.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.710 line:93%
Hold on.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.710 line:93%
(I will spray it on myself.)

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.620 line:93%
(He sprays it like a middle-aged man.)

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.050 line:93%
It should go that way.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.390 line:93%
You want to connect the middle.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.360 line:93%
It will be the frame.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.430 line:93%
(They make the frame by roping three trees.)

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.930 line:93%
We only need a roof over our heads.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.360 line:93%
- Pull hard. - That's good.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.030 line:93%
The rope is short. Leave it.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.170 line:93%
- Should I leave it? - Yes.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.470 line:93%
All right.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.800 line:93%
We can do everything with the rope.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.100 line:93%
(They complete the frame with the rope.)

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.410 line:93%
(Will they use the coconut leaves?)

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:04.710 line:93%
(They put coconut leaves over the rope.)

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.980 line:93%
Let's go.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.050 line:93%
(They don't make a slope for the rain to fall.)

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.980 line:93%
We came up with a quick plan...

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.390 line:93%
because we didn't want to work. We just needed a place to sleep.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:20.590 line:93%
We worked with the same thought...

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:23.330 line:93%
in our minds.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.200 line:93%
That's good.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.500 line:93%
(They complete the roof in 15 minutes.)

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.500 line:93%
I will throw them to you.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.800 line:93%
(They make a fireplace with coconut shells.)

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.640 line:93%
(A trunk that is rolled over...)

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.710 line:93%
It's a fireplace.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.010 line:93%
(makes a table.)

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.880 line:93%
- Isn't it a fireplace? - It's a fireplace.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.010 line:93%
It's a fireplace.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.580 line:93%
(They forgo the flooring since dirt is good for health.)

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.590 line:93%
(So far it took 20 minutes.)

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:48.850 line:93%
(Throwing)

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.220 line:93%
(They build a shelter in the shortest time...)

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.630 line:93%
(in The Law of Jungle history.)

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:54.760 line:93%
Try lying down.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.860 line:93%
It's cozier than you think.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.560 line:93%
(They only worked for 20 minutes.)

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.670 line:93%
Nice.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:02.770 line:93%
- It's nice. - Quite nice.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.240 line:93%
We are a small team,

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.310 line:93%
but the three of us...

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.570 line:93%
can win the other five.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.640 line:93%
- We have a good teamwork. - Yes.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.280 line:93%
What do you think?

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280 line:93%
- Jung Tae. - Yes?

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:16.920 line:93%
Isn't that chicken?

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.180 line:93%
- Jung Tae. - Yes?

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.990 line:93%
Isn't that chicken?

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.220 line:93%
- We should catch it. - Gosh.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.920 line:93%
Jung Tae, isn't that chicken?

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.260 line:93%
- Pick up a branch. - Should we hit them?

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.660 line:93%
Hurry. Pick up a branch.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.290 line:93%
- Pick up a branch. - Jung Tae, isn't that chicken?

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.130 line:93%
(The Vice Chief is in a hunting mode.)

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.400 line:93%
This is...

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.900 line:93%
(It's a hunting zone, not a shelter zone!)

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.930 line:93%
- There's chicken. - Chase them.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.100 line:93%
Chase them toward the sea. Hurry up.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.840 line:93%
Chase them toward the sea.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.200 line:93%
(They need to...)

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.040 line:93%
(drive the chicken toward the sea.)

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.610 line:93%
Why aren't these people moving?

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:46.880 line:93%
We said we'd take a five-minute break.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.980 line:93%
- We have a minute left. - Still...

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.680 line:93%
- They're right there. - They won't go far.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.780 line:93%
They don't have wings.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.180 line:93%
- Still... - They're angels without wings.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.250 line:93%
They're right in front of us.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.390 line:93%
We have no strength.

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:56.720 line:93%
Still, they're so close.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.190 line:93%
We said we'd take a 5-minute break.

00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.890 line:93%
Seriously? For real?

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.260 line:93%
(Is this for real?)

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.560 line:93%
- They won't leave. - No.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.260 line:93%
- Won't they? - No.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.730 line:93%
- Seriously? - Let's rest for five minutes.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.070 line:93%
There are three of them right there.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.800 line:93%
They won't go anywhere.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.100 line:93%
Do you think so too?

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.610 line:93%
That's their house.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.610 line:93%
They're not seagulls. They're chickens.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:16.740 line:93%
They won't go anywhere.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.710 line:93%
We need to drive them toward the sea, no?

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.280 line:93%
(This has never happened before.)

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.280 line:93%
I was taken aback.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.520 line:93%
They told me to sit down.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.420 line:93%
We always ran when there was something.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.690 line:93%
We even jumped in the water.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.120 line:93%
(Cock-a-doodle-doo!)

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.330 line:93%
(Whenever they heard a chicken crow,)

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.460 line:93%
(they ran as fast as they could.)

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.900 line:93%
Hey! Jump in the water and swim!

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.130 line:93%
(If we don't catch it, we'll starve.)

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.640 line:93%
(Kang Nam even dived into dirty water.)

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.440 line:93%
Yes, there were chickens.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.040 line:93%
But what should I have done?

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.780 line:93%
I had no idea we had to catch them.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.190 line:93%
We were tired after...

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:01.750 line:93%
building a shelter.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.020 line:93%
I thought they'd come back again.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.460 line:93%
I told him let's wait.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.890 line:93%
Kang Nam was funny.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:07.930 line:93%
(Only Kang Nam was antsy.)

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:10.800 line:93%
I was flustered. I was shocked.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.230 line:93%
I haven't met free souls in a long time.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:16.870 line:93%
What?

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:19.440 line:93%
Wait. This never happened before.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.410 line:93%
We can catch them. They have nowhere to go.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.280 line:93%
I've been in the jungle 10 times already,

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.110 line:93%
but I've never had a great chance like this.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.380 line:93%
Seriously, I'm getting the chills.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.680 line:93%
- You won't miss the chance. - I mean...

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.920 line:93%
I'm running a simulation.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.550 line:93%
- A simulation? - Let's say we catch them.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.050 line:93%
What will we do after?

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.660 line:93%
Who will pluck all the feathers?

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.490 line:93%
The chickens are gone. I don't see them.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:40.530 line:93%
(They're gone.)

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.290 line:93%
- It's okay. - How will you pluck the feathers?

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.000 line:93%
We have to catch them first.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.700 line:93%
Never mind. It's okay.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.330 line:93%
They have nowhere to go. They're bored.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.840 line:93%
Really? That was a great chance though.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.570 line:93%
(Byung Man,)

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.410 line:93%
Really?

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.610 line:93%
(I miss you.)

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.780 line:93%
- Guys. - Yes?

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.980 line:93%
- Let me tell you what I think. - Okay.

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.680 line:93%
- I already gave up. - First...

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:05.920 line:93%
let's catch them.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.190 line:93%
- The chickens? - Yes.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.490 line:93%
(Let's catch them.)

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:09.520 line:93%
- The chickens? - Yes.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.760 line:93%
- We should've done that earlier. - No.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.230 line:93%
They aren't in a hurry. We aren't in a hurry either.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.100 line:93%
- We just need to eat dinner. - Is that right?

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.430 line:93%
Then how will you catch the chickens?

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.430 line:93%
Don't we need to beat them with this?

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.900 line:93%
We should've beaten them earlier.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.570 line:93%
We should see what they do.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.210 line:93%
What will you beat them with? Rock?

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.210 line:93%
I wasn't going to use any tools.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.480 line:93%
(They set off to hunt.)

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.350 line:93%
- Let's go. - Wait. Let me practice.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:37.920 line:93%
Why don't you...

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.420 line:93%
try crowing?

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.250 line:93%
Let's practice.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.590 line:93%
(Ignoring)

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:43.660 line:93%
Joon Young.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.590 line:93%
Joon Young.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.660 line:93%
I'm talking to you.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.130 line:93%
- Show us. - How are you doing it?

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.130 line:93%
(I can't mimic a chicken.)

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.230 line:93%
It's okay.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.100 line:93%
(Clucking)

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.770 line:93%
(Goodness)

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.210 line:93%
(Poor Jung Tae.)

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.510 line:93%
I'm turning 50 soon. Should I really do this?

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.280 line:93%
You're great at it.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.580 line:93%
- Let's go. - He's an actor.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.650 line:93%
He really is an actor.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.010 line:93%
He can act like a chicken.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.820 line:93%
(Will they succeed in catching chickens?)

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:13.620 line:93%
The youngest members, Niel and Byung Chan...

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.220 line:93%
also start exploring the island.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.720 line:93%
What do we need to do when we explore an island?

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:22.590 line:93%
Based on my experience...

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.760 line:93%
Based on your experience...

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.730 line:93%
- I was an ace. - I see.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.130 line:93%
- Because it's low tide... - What's in there?

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.870 line:93%
we need to see what's in the water.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.670 line:93%
We should see if there are any coconuts hanging low.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.210 line:93%
Don't pick them?

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.580 line:93%
We do. We pick them if we can.

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.380 line:93%
You always have to look carefully.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.250 line:93%
We might catch something unexpected.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.350 line:93%
(Follow me!)

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.550 line:93%
(Let's see.)

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.790 line:93%
Is this something you were talking about?

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.830 line:93%
I've never eaten a coconut.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:54.890 line:93%
Me neither.

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.330 line:93%
Coconut oil...

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.630 line:93%
I hear liquid.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.970 line:93%
- Should we try opening it? - Can we eat this?

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.240 line:93%
- It's gone bad though. - Has it gone bad?

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.300 line:93%
- Hasn't it? - But it doesn't smell.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.410 line:93%
- Let's take it. - Let's bring it with us.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.340 line:93%
- It's just one. - Yes.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.480 line:93%
Wait. What's this?

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.210 line:93%
Is there something?

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.450 line:93%
This.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.290 line:93%
Isn't it a sea cucumber?

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:24.060 line:93%
We can't bring this. Let's just remember.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.090 line:93%
We'll remember this.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.860 line:93%
Just remember that there was a sea cucumber.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.430 line:93%
Let's not go in there.

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:31.630 line:93%
(Stopping)

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.630 line:93%
- Because it's scary. - Yes.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:36.330 line:93%
Just tell the others we found a place like this.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.340 line:93%
Yes.

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.500 line:93%
- Let's just remember it. - Okay.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.240 line:93%
There's a coconut path.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.370 line:93%
Yes.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.740 line:93%
Look at this.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.650 line:93%
It's a fish.

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.180 line:93%
(They find a small fish.)

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.050 line:93%
Remember that. We have three things to remember.

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:53.420 line:93%
Bring your mom.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.690 line:93%
Let's remember this spot.

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:56.690 line:93%
(Let's not forget the lesson from the experienced.)

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.090 line:93%
An advice from the experienced.

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:00.590 line:93%
I will escort you, so don't worry.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.630 line:93%
(They eagerly memorize everything.)

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:02.690 line:93%
Don't worry.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.430 line:93%
If we go this way...

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.900 line:93%
There's a crab!

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.030 line:93%
- On the rock! - Let's get that.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:10.140 line:93%
We have to get it.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.140 line:93%
- How? - With our hands.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.210 line:93%
(They're eager to get there.)

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:14.870 line:93%
I have no hands.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.470 line:93%
I'll throw this coconut.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.410 line:93%
- There are crabs here. - Yes.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.910 line:93%
- Where is it? - On that side.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.080 line:93%
Right in front of you.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.450 line:93%
- Here? - Yes. I'll go there.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:26.620 line:93%
- Here. - Where?

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.720 line:93%
Here.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.820 line:93%
It's here.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:30.920 line:93%
Hit it with the stick and make it faint.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.230 line:93%
- There. - It's there.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:34.330 line:93%
- There. - The crab.

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:35.930 line:93%
Byung Chan.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.330 line:93%
Byung Chan.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.660 line:93%
It's over there. It's going in.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.670 line:93%
- Where? Did you check where it is? - Here.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.770 line:93%
- Over here. - Where? Corner it.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.900 line:93%
Stay there. Ill go the other way.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.740 line:93%
(The crab is stuck.)

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.780 line:93%
- No. - Go over there.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.040 line:93%
- I'll go over there. - Okay.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.180 line:93%
- Then I'll go this way again. - Okay.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:55.780 line:93%
It's right in there.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.150 line:93%
Let's break this stick and share it.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.380 line:93%
- Okay. Break it. - Okay.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.650 line:93%
(Byung Chan starts sawing.)

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:03.920 line:93%
Wait. Look.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:05.760 line:93%
You need to use your brain.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.130 line:93%
- Wait. I'm sawing it. - I'll catch it.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.200 line:93%
(Sawing)

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.770 line:93%
When will it get done?

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:16.570 line:93%
I can do it!

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:19.640 line:93%
(It won't break.)

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.470 line:93%
- Put it here. Look. - Byung Chan.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.580 line:93%
(Goodness, Byung Chan.)

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.710 line:93%
Yes, like that.

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.680 line:93%
What if it ran away?

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.220 line:93%
This is taking too long.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.520 line:93%
Should I stomp on this? I think it'll break.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.920 line:93%
No, turn it around.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:37.820 line:93%
(Niel starts sawing instead.)

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.960 line:93%
Now, break it.

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:43.660 line:93%
Not like that. The other way.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.460 line:93%
Good. Like that.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.230 line:93%
- That's it, Byung Chan. - Okay.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.800 line:93%
All right. We'll catch it now.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.400 line:93%
Are you ready?

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.570 line:93%
(All right. Let's catch it now!)

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.570 line:93%
This way.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:55.810 line:93%
I think there's a rock.

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.310 line:93%
It's coming out.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:58.780 line:93%
- It's getting out. - There.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.910 line:93%
- Don't move. - Okay.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:03.080 line:93%
Calm down.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.180 line:93%
(Moving away)

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.380 line:93%
Don't move.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.520 line:93%
Hey, it jumped.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.990 line:93%
I told you it jumps.

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.430 line:93%
- Where did it go? - Underneath it.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.730 line:93%
- Underneath my foot? - Under the rock.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:16.830 line:93%
- Here? - Yes.

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:18.100 line:93%
- Where? - Next to it.

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.130 line:93%
- Where? - Here.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.570 line:93%
That's not it.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.040 line:93%
That isn't it. Is it?

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.270 line:93%
(Hey, crab. Where are you?)

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.310 line:93%
I can't see.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.980 line:93%
What's this?

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.310 line:93%
- Hey, Byung Chan. - What's wrong?

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.520 line:93%
Don't go after the crab. Let's take this.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.580 line:93%
(He picks up calliostoma unicum.)

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.680 line:93%
Get the easy ones first.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.720 line:93%
(This is how an experienced person hunts.)

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:44.460 line:93%
(He switches targets quickly...)

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.960 line:93%
(in order to survive in the jungle.)

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.690 line:93%
Look at this.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.060 line:93%
- What's that? - What's this?

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.800 line:93%
- This is something different. - What's that?

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800 line:93%
(They're good at catching inanimate things.)

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.830 line:93%
What's this?

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:57.700 line:93%
Hey. It's perfect.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.500 line:93%
- You're so good. - This is perfect.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.910 line:93%
We caught a lot.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.640 line:93%
This is a lot.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.910 line:93%
You sure are the experienced one.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.850 line:93%
You just have to count on me.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.280 line:93%
Jung Chul and Da Hee...

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:13.750 line:93%
might not have caught anything.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:14.820 line:93%
- You're right. - Yes.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.390 line:93%
- So we have to... - We have to work as twice as hard.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.030 line:93%
There's a crab! I see it.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.630 line:93%
- Where? - Over there.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.160 line:93%
- You have a great eyesight. - It's on the sand.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.230 line:93%
We can do it, Byung Chan.

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.640 line:93%
Imagine what it would taste like.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.170 line:93%
- Think about it. - It must be tasty.

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.640 line:93%
- It'll be delicious. - Won't it?

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.140 line:93%
- It must be good. - Of course.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:37.380 line:93%
With one crab...

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.680 line:93%
Let's be manly.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:40.850 line:93%
I'll do it.

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:41.850 line:93%
(Let's catch this guy.)

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.680 line:93%
(Niel hands over the gastropod, and gets ready to catch the crab.)

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.290 line:93%
(Come on out.)

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.290 line:93%
I can do it.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.160 line:93%
Here they are.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.560 line:93%
They came out from here!

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.160 line:93%
- They are out, right? Where? - They are here!

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.460 line:93%
(The crabs come out to avoid his attack.)

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.600 line:93%
Where? Are they all out?

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.670 line:93%
You, punks! You! Gosh.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.070 line:93%
Byung Chan, can you shake the stick between the rocks?

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.070 line:93%
(Let me put them here first.)

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.770 line:93%
Why are the stones so big?

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.770 line:93%
(He wants to put down gastropods they caught.)

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.710 line:93%
(Unable to find his way)

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.610 line:93%
Why can't I find a normal-looking stone here?

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.520 line:93%
Byung Chan, the sun might start setting.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.520 line:93%
First, flip it, and put it down on the ground.

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.390 line:93%
You can do it, right? There you go.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.560 line:93%
(Goodness, Byung Chan.)

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.360 line:93%
(Byung Chan finally helps.)

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.460 line:93%
I can't do it anymore.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.060 line:93%
- I can't do this. - How do I manage this? Gosh.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.170 line:93%
- Come on. - Go for it, Byung Chan.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:35.300 line:93%
- Come. - It's time for you to go for it.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:38.200 line:93%
- Goodness. - Byung Chan!

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:39.910 line:93%
Come back here.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.310 line:93%
Crabs, no. Don't lift your claws.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:42.740 line:93%
Hey, hurry!

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.240 line:93%
Don't lift your claws. Hold on a second, Niel.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.250 line:93%
My arms are about to go numb. I'm serious.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.710 line:93%
I'm scared to death right now.

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:51.180 line:93%
I'm really scared.

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.050 line:93%
- I can see it, but... - Come on. Go for it now.

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.250 line:93%
If it came out, you'd better do it quickly.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.760 line:93%
It's coming out.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.790 line:93%
(The crab is slowly coming about.)

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.160 line:93%
Come back here, punk. No, it went back in.

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.260 line:93%
(He pushes the crab back.)

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.360 line:93%
It's out.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.970 line:93%
(It comes out, but goes back in.)

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:09.770 line:93%
No, forget it, Niel. It's over.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:12.000 line:93%
It's over.

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.340 line:93%
- You got it then? - No, it went back in.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.570 line:93%
- Sorry? - It went back in.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.310 line:93%
(My goodness.)

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.280 line:93%
Hey, we should get more people on this.

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.220 line:93%
- Right? So we should hurry back. - Okay.

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:25.920 line:93%
Let's bring Jung Chul and Da Hee back here.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.290 line:93%
I don't think we can handle this on our own.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.690 line:93%
Wait, that. What is that?

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.060 line:93%
Where?

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:34.460 line:93%
It's right there.

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.530 line:93%
- Where? - There! Hey, stay calm.

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.170 line:93%
- Where is it? - Stay calm. Be calm.

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.770 line:93%
(There's a crab under the rock.)

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:43.070 line:93%
- Don't move. - Okay.

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:44.070 line:93%
All right.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.940 line:93%
Wing-formation.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.640 line:93%
Wing-formation.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:50.540 line:93%
- Hey, go that way. - I'll go that way.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.680 line:93%
- I'll go that way. - Go that way.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.180 line:93%
You can do this.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.310 line:93%
- I can do this. - Get ready.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.410 line:93%
We'll use the wing-formation method.

00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:58.650 line:93%
- Go, go, go! - Here.

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:00.190 line:93%
(March on!)

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:02.650 line:93%
(Dashing away)

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:04.290 line:93%
- Here it is. - Hey.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.990 line:93%
Hold it down. Hold it down.

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.090 line:93%
No, hold it down.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.890 line:93%
(Moving away)

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:10.730 line:93%
(Byung Chan moves away from the crab as he's startled.)

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.260 line:93%
- Press it down. - No!

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000 line:93%
Where did it go?

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:16.570 line:93%
We can catch this, right? We can do this, can't we?

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.270 line:93%
- Pardon? - It came out!

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:20.810 line:93%
- Where is it? - Hey, Byung Chan.

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.440 line:93%
- I'll be on the other side. - I'll block this part.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.040 line:93%
(The crab runs away quickly while pacing back and forth.)

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.650 line:93%
(Niel chases after the crab like a persistent chaser.)

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.020 line:93%
I got it! I got it!

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.780 line:93%
Hey, hey. Just keep it down. Press it down.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.880 line:93%
I'm holding the claws down.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.690 line:93%
What do I do with this? How do I catch it?

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:36.820 line:93%
Do I hold the claws?

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.860 line:93%
You must hold the both sides from the back.

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.860 line:93%
From the back? Flip it.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.930 line:93%
Wait a second. I'm holding the crab now.

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.900 line:93%
- Watch this. We can do this. - I'm holding it down too.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.470 line:93%
- I'm holding the claws. - Should I let this go now?

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:49.800 line:93%
- No, don't let go. - Okay.

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:53.370 line:93%
I'm holding two claws now. Let it go now.

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:54.670 line:93%
All right. Here.

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.640 line:93%
No, catch it!

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.610 line:93%
No, no. It's right here.

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:00.980 line:93%
- I got it. - You got it?

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.650 line:93%
- I have it. - Don't press it hard. It will die.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.480 line:93%
We can do this. Hey, my friend.

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:08.720 line:93%
I did it. I did it!

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720 line:93%
(At last,)

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.260 line:93%
(he catches the crab!)

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.360 line:93%
(We did it!)

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.200 line:93%
We got it.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.800 line:93%
Were you screaming?

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:23.800 line:93%
Let's go. Let's get going now.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.770 line:93%
- Admiral Yi Sun Shin's formation. - You bet.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.110 line:93%
- It's amazing. - Of course, it is.

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.280 line:93%
Let's stop looking for more food.

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.650 line:93%
Let's go.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.880 line:93%
Hey, there's more. There are 2... 3 crabs.

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.280 line:93%
Byung Chan, it's your turn now. I can't use my hands.

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.320 line:93%
But that one is bigger.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.550 line:93%
Right. So should we release this guy?

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:42.650 line:93%
No, that's not it.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.890 line:93%
Should I hold it for you?

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.960 line:93%
This might run away from you.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.460 line:93%
Let's go.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.190 line:93%
- Let's do our high-five later. - Okay.

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:50.360 line:93%
(Let's stop exploring.)

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.170 line:93%
- Hey, guys! - Let's go.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.900 line:93%
We brought gastropods and a crab.

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.570 line:93%
- You caught a crab? - Yes, there were so many.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.110 line:93%
- We saw many of them. - Aren't they fast?

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.310 line:93%
Niel caught it.

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.240 line:93%
They jumped around even.

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.750 line:93%
- They jumped around? - Yes.

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:09.450 line:93%
- I guess crabs are quite athletic. - They were pretty athletic.

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:13.050 line:93%
- Can one of you help me with this? - Yes, I'll help.

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.020 line:93%
(Carrying)

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:20.260 line:93%
(Her instinct to run is unstoppable.)

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.860 line:93%
(She's full of energy.)

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.970 line:93%
(Da Hee can gather all the materials for the roof alone.)

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:31.970 line:93%
Where did it go?

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:34.070 line:93%
- Let's go. - Go.

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:35.870 line:93%
Watch your feet.

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.080 line:93%
Let's move at the same pace. Don't move too fast.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.080 line:93%
(They work together.)

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.710 line:93%
- This side is heavier. - Watch out for the stone.

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:44.920 line:93%
- This side is moving too fast. - That side is too heavy.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.120 line:93%
That side is too heavy.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.150 line:93%
- I'll move closer to your side. - Okay, move closer.

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.160 line:93%
I will...

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.190 line:93%
move it with you. Why isn't it moving?

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:53.590 line:93%
That one is really heavy.

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:55.990 line:93%
1, 2, 3.

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.760 line:93%
(Did someone just pass by us?)

00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.900 line:93%
Okay.

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:02.770 line:93%
(Pulling)

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:03.770 line:93%
Goodness.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:06.070 line:93%
- Are we almost there? - We're almost there.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.240 line:93%
I'm not sure anymore.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.440 line:93%
Wait.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.250 line:93%
(They finish delivering the log in the end.)

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.150 line:93%
- We are almost there. - We're close now.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:17.450 line:93%
Let's take a breather.

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:20.290 line:93%
- Should we take a break? - No, no. You guys can't do this.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.560 line:93%
(Da Hee helps the Chief to build the house.)

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.790 line:93%
Where should I put this?

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.700 line:93%
(Byung Man picked up every discarded nail.)

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.070 line:93%
- Here? - This one is great too.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.200 line:93%
(They reuse the discarded table systematically.)

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:45.280 line:93%
That's right. We should put it down vertically.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.340 line:93%
(They work together to build their first house.)

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.550 line:93%
Watch your hands.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.650 line:93%
(With the Chief's planning and their effort...)

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.290 line:93%
- It's done. - Yes, it is.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.950 line:93%
Okay. This is nice.

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:58.760 line:93%
Gosh, I just want to go to the other side on this right now.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.260 line:93%
(Feeling proud)

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.460 line:93%
Since there are five of us,

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:09.170 line:93%
two of us should go to the sea...

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.640 line:93%
(Thanks to him, their survival is more organized.)

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.970 line:93%
Can you go into the water and pick up some gastropods?

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.840 line:93%
Should I go? Da Hee, do you want to join me?

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.040 line:93%
- Okay. - Da Hee and Byung Chan can go.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.680 line:93%
Da Hee and Byung Chan can go.

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.980 line:93%
- She's smiling that she's going. - Aren't you happy?

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.080 line:93%
Come on. Hurry.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.220 line:93%
- I guess she must feel hot. - Exactly.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.190 line:93%
Niel, I invited you because of this house.

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:30.190 line:93%
- I knew it. - Right.

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.020 line:93%
I'm quite good at building houses.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.560 line:93%
- I want you to do only hard stuff. - Okay, okay. I got it.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.660 line:93%
- We'll be back. - we'll be back.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.100 line:93%
- I'll see you later. - Da Hee, bring us a lot of food.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.370 line:93%
- You know our storage box? - Yes.

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:46.070 line:93%
Make our storage box look like an island from here.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.570 line:93%
- I got it. - I hope you make a pile with them.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.880 line:93%
- Okay. Bye. - See you later.

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.650 line:93%
Da Hee's face is red.

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:58.220 line:93%
She worked hard too.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.150 line:93%
Am I that red?

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.120 line:93%
You look like an apple.

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:04.790 line:93%
A plum?

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.160 line:93%
(His right hand is fixed there.)

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.360 line:93%
That's a good thing then.

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:11.360 line:93%
- Do it just like this. - I see.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.760 line:93%
- You can split it? - Yes.

01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:16.430 line:93%
Make sure you don't hurt your fingers. Start from thin parts.

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.740 line:93%
(Niel begins splitting the leaves.)

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.840 line:93%
Put them on the longer side.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:21.340 line:93%
Alternate the leaves.

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:22.610 line:93%
- Alternate them? - Yes.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.840 line:93%
(He strengthened the safety with nails Da Hee brought.)

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:28.410 line:93%
(But...)

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.620 line:93%
(Da Hee isn't here.)

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.780 line:93%
(Without Da Hee, the energizer,)

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.650 line:93%
(the mood gets somber.)

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.830 line:93%
You can find some bushes there. Can you give them to me?

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.090 line:93%
They are underneath that.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.460 line:93%
(These three guys...)

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.160 line:93%
(quietly focus on working.)

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.870 line:93%
Byung Man never takes a break.

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:51.370 line:93%
- You know in the sand, - Yes?

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:52.370 line:93%
we need a table.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.340 line:93%
(He recycles leftovers.)

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.840 line:93%
Let's make a table. We need it for dinner.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.210 line:93%
When we put this up...

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.280 line:93%
With this,

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.180 line:93%
when we cook, the sand won't get into the food.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.150 line:93%
If we place this underneath, it'd be perfect.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.020 line:93%
(It's spacious for five people.)

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.460 line:93%
When we all lie down here,

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.690 line:93%
- everyone can fit in. - Yes, we can.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.930 line:93%
(The roof will stop the rain and wind.)

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:18.260 line:93%
This is amazing.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.560 line:93%
(The roof will stop the rain and wind.)

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:25.000 line:93%
I only see the sea inside this triangle.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.070 line:93%
(We invite you to the house with an ocean view.)

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:27.810 line:93%
The view is spectacular.

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.940 line:93%
- It's nice, isn't it? - It's amazing.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.640 line:93%
- All right. - All right.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.250 line:93%
- Good job. - Well done, everyone.

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.880 line:93%
All right. We'll move to the next island.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.850 line:93%
We'll move to the next island.

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:40.720 line:93%
We're doomed.

01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:43.860 line:93%
In my head, I had a plan to build the house right here.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.060 line:93%
- Should we start? - Let's go.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.830 line:93%
- Where are we going? - Let's get going first.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.060 line:93%
- Let's go quietly. - Should we walk around it first?

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.130 line:93%
- Sure. - Okay?

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.470 line:93%
- They will run away. - You can't run like that.

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.970 line:93%
(You'll startle them, and they'll run away.)

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.040 line:93%
(To catch chickens,)

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.180 line:93%
(making the sounds is nothing.)

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:08.350 line:93%
Should we wait in the shadow and come back when they show up?

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.420 line:93%
(The flock of wild chickens disappeared into thin air.)

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.620 line:93%
Hey, can't we lure them out with food?

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.990 line:93%
We can use the coconuts. They eat coconuts.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.890 line:93%
- Really? - They'll come back when we wait.

01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.400 line:93%
Should we pick some coconuts and put them here?

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:26.970 line:93%
- Here? - I'm not sure.

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.270 line:93%
I'm certain they will come back here...

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:30.570 line:93%
because there are a lot of coconuts here.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.000 line:93%
We should pick one of those coconuts there.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.210 line:93%
Go for it.

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.640 line:93%
(They find coconuts right next to their camp.)

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.240 line:93%
(Wait.)

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.880 line:93%
Can't you climb up on top of the wood block?

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.650 line:93%
- Here. - Can't you do it? You're tall.

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:46.820 line:93%
Okay. I'll give it a go. But we are about the same height.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.020 line:93%
- Really? - Try it with this.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.760 line:93%
I'll hold you.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.330 line:93%
I'll hold you.

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.530 line:93%
- Are you left-handed? - Yes.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.960 line:93%
Then you have to face the other way.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.030 line:93%
(He's completely focused.)

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:05.040 line:93%
(He begins wielding his knife furiously.)

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.740 line:93%
That's great. Great.

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:08.970 line:93%
That's excellent.

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:12.080 line:93%
- Yes! You're so cool. - Gosh, what a cool guy.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.180 line:93%
You're so cool.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.150 line:93%
There, there. No, not there. Aim that part.

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:16.620 line:93%
Yes, you can cut that part.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.320 line:93%
Yes, yes! Here we go!

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.050 line:93%
Go, go! You can do it!

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.420 line:93%
You can do it!

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.490 line:93%
- Goodness, you're so noisy! - I'm sorry.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.960 line:93%
- I'm sorry. - You're almost there.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.290 line:93%
I wanted to cheer for you.

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.630 line:93%
Great, great. Keep knifing the same part.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:32.930 line:93%
(Noises Kang Nam makes break him down.)

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:33.930 line:93%
What should I do?

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.930 line:93%
(Gosh, he's draining my energy.)

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:36.970 line:93%
Cut the same part.

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.300 line:93%
- Don't rest. You're tired. - Wait.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.510 line:93%
- You're almost done. You're close. - Jump at the end.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.540 line:93%
- Jump! - Let's get him out.

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:45.840 line:93%
- How can he do that? - Hey, come here.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.110 line:93%
- Pardon? - Let me step on your shoulders.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.180 line:93%
- Shoulders? - Yes.

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:50.080 line:93%
- Let me use your shoulders. - Like this?

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.150 line:93%
(He steps on the shoulders.)

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:52.180 line:93%
My goodness.

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:54.790 line:93%
- Hey, here you go. - Should you do this, Joon Young?

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:55.820 line:93%
Be careful.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.190 line:93%
Hey, my back is about to snap.

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.260 line:93%
- This is... - Jung Tae, hurry.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.360 line:93%
- Hurry. - Give that to me. Come on.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.500 line:93%
- Come on, hurry. - Hang onto the branch.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.530 line:93%
Hey.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.130 line:93%
- That's even scarier. - Get the coconuts. I'm dying here.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.230 line:93%
(Staggering)

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:10.400 line:93%
I'm dying here.

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.840 line:93%
Hold on a second. Hey, hey. No, no.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.910 line:93%
(He's panicking.)

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.210 line:93%
Hold on, Jung Tae. Wait.

01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.210 line:93%
Just come down.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.480 line:93%
(Kang Nam could have cost his life just to pick coconuts for chickens.)

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:23.150 line:93%
- Move aside. - Goodness.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.520 line:93%
Hey, why couldn't you endure a bit longer?

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.220 line:93%
- How much do you weigh? - Hey!

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.290 line:93%
What's your weight?

01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:31.690 line:93%
Hey!

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.960 line:93%
(He picks it at once.)

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.290 line:93%
- How did you... - How could...

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.730 line:93%
- Okay. - Okay.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.000 line:93%
- We need to crack this. - Come here.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.600 line:93%
- The ax. - Bring the ax.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.070 line:93%
- I'll do it. - That's easy. I can crack it.

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:48.540 line:93%
- Hey. - Let's take five minutes.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.710 line:93%
Okay, let's rest for five.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.550 line:93%
- Hey, but our plan... - Teamwork?

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.080 line:93%
- to get closer was great. - It was, wasn't it?

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.350 line:93%
- Let's keep our alliance going. - You bet.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.360 line:93%
We're wasting coconut water.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.290 line:93%
The sand got in. The sand got in. You'll be drinking the sand.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:08.560 line:93%
(The coconut water is sprung.)

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.690 line:93%
Drink it. You should drink.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.100 line:93%
(Gushing out)

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.430 line:93%
(Chocking)

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.300 line:93%
Jung Tae. No, what a waste.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.470 line:93%
(He can't even drink.)

01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:20.740 line:93%
You. My nose.

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:22.610 line:93%
(I'm sorry, Jung Tae.)

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:25.680 line:93%
(Kang Nam takes care of Joon Young.)

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:28.050 line:93%
(Sighing)

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.210 line:93%
It's so sweet.

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.150 line:93%
(I feel so much better.)

01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:34.350 line:93%
(He wants to eat the inside too.)

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.790 line:93%
There's another wooden block. Use this instead.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.260 line:93%
Drink it all.

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.290 line:93%
Wait. There's nothing inside.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.200 line:93%
What? Why is it empty?

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.200 line:93%
What? Why is it empty?

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:52.000 line:93%
Then let's crack one on the ground. Like that one.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.240 line:93%
(They check just in case.)

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:56.170 line:93%
(He picks up coconuts on the ground.)

01:07:58.110 --> 01:07:59.380 line:93%
- Is it in there? - Yes.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.320 line:93%
- There's a bit left. - Yes, there is.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.590 line:93%
This is the sweet part.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.090 line:93%
- It's the white part. - That.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.230 line:93%
Try it. It's sweet.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.330 line:93%
Well...

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.760 line:93%
(Since my blood sugar is low, let me try it.)

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.860 line:93%
Isn't it sweet?

01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.830 line:93%
(He's tasting the coconut.)

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:24.940 line:93%
(Spitting out)

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.710 line:93%
Gosh, how can this be sweet? It's not sugar.

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:28.340 line:93%
(To wild chickens, it's the perfect bait.)

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.340 line:93%
- Isn't that enough to lure them? - Right. Let's take it for now.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.110 line:93%
- Must I spread it where they were? - Yes, spread it in the middle.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.780 line:93%
The flat ground where they were earlier.

01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:41.950 line:93%
(Our backyard will be the graveyard for the chickens.)

01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.630 line:93%
- My gosh, I'm losing my energy. - You are, right?

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:49.730 line:93%
That's why you must eat.

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.160 line:93%
- We must eat. - Let's hurry.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.400 line:93%
Let's go pick up clams.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:54.970 line:93%
- Sorry? - Let's pick up clams.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.800 line:93%
- Who? - Clams.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.440 line:93%
- Gastropods. - Are we picking clams now?

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.540 line:93%
Yes, we must do it now. Let's get going.

01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:03.140 line:93%
We'll go in the water?

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.680 line:93%
(Meanwhile, on the other side of the island,)

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.920 line:93%
(Da Hee and Byung Chan are getting ready to hunt underwater.)

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.890 line:93%
(It seems they are making something.)

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:18.290 line:93%
What are you making now?

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:22.930 line:93%
I heard that there are so many murexes here.

01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:25.160 line:93%
I'm making a net to put those in.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.470 line:93%
I couldn't catch crabs. Will I be able to find murexes instead?

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.970 line:93%
I can't catch living things.

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:34.410 line:93%
(Just trust me.)

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.940 line:93%
(Da Hee makes a fish net with the laundry net.)

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.810 line:93%
I'm not sure if I'm strong or not.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.550 line:93%
But I can be quite stubborn.

01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:45.550 line:93%
I don't give up until I make it happen.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.390 line:93%
I don't think I can come back empty-handed.

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:54.090 line:93%
I think I might have nightmares if I come back empty-handed.

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:56.630 line:93%
- Is that so? - Yes. I have to catch something.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.560 line:93%
(Before the shoot, underwater training center)

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.170 line:93%
I like being in the water. I like swimming too.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.040 line:93%
I learned I must be good at underwater swimming for this show.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.080 line:93%
I've never done that.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.280 line:93%
I'm planning to practice though.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.310 line:93%
(Da Hee keeps on practicing.)

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:17.580 line:93%
(2 hours later since her practice started)

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:25.260 line:93%
(After putting a lot of effort, she got used to underwater swimming.)

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:32.130 line:93%
(Will her practice pay off?)

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:37.740 line:93%
(These two, who look like models, set out to the sea.)

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.810 line:93%
(Looking courageous)

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.810 line:93%
- It startled me. - Why?

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.780 line:93%
- It startled me. - Why?

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:52.050 line:93%
- Didn't you catch this earlier? - I haven't seen this.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:54.190 line:93%
- No, we didn't. - Let's go there.

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:56.760 line:93%
(Trust me, and just follow me.)

01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.990 line:93%
(This rocky island is their goal.)

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:02.430 line:93%
You have to be careful. I fell on my bottom earlier.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.560 line:93%
(She checks her flippers.)

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.300 line:93%
(They put on the gloves.)

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:11.770 line:93%
Okay.

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.370 line:93%
(Da Hee gets comfortable.)

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:14.410 line:93%
Let's do it sitting down.

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:15.470 line:93%
(Da Hee gets comfortable.)

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.850 line:93%
(The youngest follows Da Hee's lead.)

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:22.350 line:93%
You seem happy now that you'll be going into the water.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.880 line:93%
I love being in the water.

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.090 line:93%
- It seems like it. - Pardon?

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:28.590 line:93%
(Da Hee is in her element.)

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:30.190 line:93%
I don't think it will be scary.

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:36.260 line:93%
An actress just spat on TV.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.300 line:93%
(She doesn't care about her image.)

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.570 line:93%
(Byung Chan, the youngest. Our group's pride is at stake.)

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.630 line:93%
Do you think there will be fish?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.840 line:93%
I hope so.

01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:49.110 line:93%
(I can catch them.)

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.040 line:93%
For this moment, she was trained and prepared the gears.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.450 line:93%
Da Hee, the enthusiast, and Byung Chan are fully ready.

01:11:56.650 --> 01:12:00.020 line:93%
With strong will and high hopes, she sets into the water.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.820 line:93%
Will her expectations bear fruits?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.160 line:93%
(What's the result of her first hurting?)

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.290 line:93%
Next week.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.600 line:93%
(Their survival of laid-back guys isn't over.)

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.440 line:93%
(He, who is starving, jumps into the water.)

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.170 line:93%
(But it's not easy.)

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.480 line:93%
(Meanwhile, the Chief's survival is systematic.)

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.650 line:93%
(The momentum is great,)

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:32.520 line:93%
(and so is their teamwork.)

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.150 line:93%
(The Chief ventures out!)

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:37.260 line:93%
(The most luxurious survival on the Chief's island)

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.660 line:93%
That looks so good.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.990 line:93%
(Next day)

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.730 line:93%
We have an announcement to make.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:49.370 line:93%
(Their base camps must be switched from that point on.)

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.100 line:93%
(The Law of Jungle in Cook Islands)
