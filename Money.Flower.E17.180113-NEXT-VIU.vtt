00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.574 line:93%
(Episode 17)

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:07.964 line:93%
Where's Ha Jung?

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:10.694 line:93%
He's sleeping inside.

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:22.845 line:93%
Hello, Director Jang.

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:24.914 line:93%
Hello. Please take the child.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.285 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:31.884 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:38.194 line:93%
I'm just asking her to keep an eye on him.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.065 line:93%
If we raise our voices,

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:42.834 line:93%
he might be scared.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.005 line:93%
I heard...

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:29.014 line:93%
Pil Joo brought you here,

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:31.944 line:93%
so you can make your own decision about the press conference.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:36.384 line:93%
Did you make up your mind yet?

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:39.685 line:93%
Not yet.

00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:42.954 line:93%
What are you hesitating about?

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:46.394 line:93%
About what I will say there.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.764 line:93%
What I should tell the press to hurt...

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:53.965 line:93%
you and Executive Jung.

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.444 line:93%
I'm hesitating because I can't come up with what to say.

00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:47.854 line:93%
For the sake of Ha Jung.

00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:58.104 line:93%
Seo Won.

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:02.775 line:93%
I let you slide for the sake of Ha Jung...

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.375 line:93%
since you're his mother.

00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:17.585 line:93%
It's a one-time deal.

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.124 line:93%
And you...

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:26.424 line:93%
used it just now.

00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:30.135 line:93%
Boo Cheon.

00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:43.544 line:93%
Now,

00:04:44.044 --> 00:04:45.184 line:93%
there is...

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:46.845 line:93%
a reason...

00:04:49.614 --> 00:04:52.385 line:93%
I must be the chairman even if it costs my life.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.994 line:93%
I must become the chairman as if my life depends on it.

00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:03.364 line:93%
I don't have to keep...

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:09.775 line:93%
those, who stand in my way, alive.

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:15.044 line:93%
Seo Won.

00:05:19.484 --> 00:05:21.414 line:93%
If I begged you this much,

00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.184 line:93%
shouldn't it be enough?

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:39.405 line:93%
Must I...

00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:43.335 line:93%
beg more than this?

00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:05.095 line:93%
If you eliminated Yoon Seo Won that time,

00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:07.734 line:93%
she wouldn't have been able to cause trouble.

00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:10.664 line:93%
What if that lowlife holds the press conference...

00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:13.004 line:93%
and ruins Boo Cheon? What will you do then?

00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:20.004 line:93%
You only caused our son to injure his leg.

00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:21.814 line:93%
Secretary Oh, do you know that...

00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:24.414 line:93%
you're only harming Boo Cheon?

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.494 line:93%
Kang Pil Joo isn't answering my call.

00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:39.965 line:93%
Bring him to me.

00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:13.564 line:93%
Ms. Na.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:49.765 line:93%
It's eventually back...

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.265 line:93%
to the original owner after 20 years.

00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:56.905 line:93%
This is the only thing...

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.674 line:93%
my dad left to me.

00:08:03.645 --> 00:08:04.914 line:93%
Thank you, Ms. Na.

00:08:07.484 --> 00:08:08.585 line:93%
You're welcome,

00:08:09.885 --> 00:08:11.124 line:93%
Mr. Jang Eun Cheon.

00:08:26.604 --> 00:08:28.135 line:93%
Ms. Icheon...

00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:31.075 line:93%
recognized that necklace.

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:36.915 line:93%
She said Grandfather gave it to Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man.

00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:44.425 line:93%
I thought you were Jo In Ho,

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:47.854 line:93%
but you were Kang Pil Joo.

00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:52.695 line:93%
Then I thought you were Kang Pil Joo,

00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:59.234 line:93%
but you are Jang Eun Cheon.

00:09:09.874 --> 00:09:11.315 line:93%
Kang Pil Joo's memorial service.

00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:17.884 line:93%
I saw you having a memorial service...

00:09:18.784 --> 00:09:21.455 line:93%
with a name plaque for Kang Pil Joo.

00:09:26.124 --> 00:09:29.234 line:93%
When I saw you having the service with your own name plaque,

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:31.935 line:93%
I thought about what made you...

00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:34.874 line:93%
walk into the river when you were young.

00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:39.244 line:93%
It must have been something...

00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:43.514 line:93%
terrible and despicable I can't even fathom.

00:09:45.644 --> 00:09:47.455 line:93%
And it's not over yet.

00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:52.124 line:93%
That's what I thought.

00:09:57.624 --> 00:10:00.024 line:93%
I'll take back what I said...

00:10:01.864 --> 00:10:03.134 line:93%
about you living happy.

00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:09.435 line:93%
No matter what you say,

00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:12.945 line:93%
when you can't use your real name,

00:10:14.945 --> 00:10:16.845 line:93%
you're not living well.

00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:23.784 line:93%
I need to know...

00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:29.825 line:93%
me, Boo Cheon, and you...

00:10:32.624 --> 00:10:33.795 line:93%
How three of us...

00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:37.264 line:93%
got here.

00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:39.565 line:93%
And why you are...

00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:43.935 line:93%
hiding your real name...

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.004 line:93%
and living in Cheon A.

00:10:52.884 --> 00:10:54.555 line:93%
I believe I have the right...

00:10:56.854 --> 00:10:58.185 line:93%
to ask you.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.234 line:93%
I'll tell you,

00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:18.774 line:93%
but...

00:11:21.345 --> 00:11:23.114 line:93%
if you want to hear my story,

00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:27.014 line:93%
you have to be ready for it.

00:11:29.384 --> 00:11:31.254 line:93%
You need to be ready...

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:35.595 line:93%
to hear...

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.225 line:93%
anything I have to say.

00:11:43.095 --> 00:11:45.665 line:93%
Come back when you're ready.

00:11:47.234 --> 00:11:48.604 line:93%
I am...

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.075 line:93%
ready for it.

00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:54.744 line:93%
So...

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:57.685 line:93%
tell me.

00:12:07.384 --> 00:12:08.394 line:93%
Attorney Kang.

00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:18.065 line:93%
You need to see Executive Jung now.

00:12:18.364 --> 00:12:20.805 line:93%
She said she called you several times, but you didn't pick up.

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.555 line:93%
Have you found Yoon Seo Won, that witch?

00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:44.864 line:93%
Yes. Boo Cheon's on his way to meet her.

00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:47.634 line:93%
You sent him alone?

00:12:48.764 --> 00:12:51.165 line:93%
He doesn't know anything. What's he going to do?

00:12:51.734 --> 00:12:53.134 line:93%
No one can...

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.835 line:93%
communicate with her better than him.

00:12:56.305 --> 00:12:58.675 line:93%
They even have a child.

00:12:58.874 --> 00:13:02.445 line:93%
I didn't ask how well they get along.

00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:04.644 line:93%
That's not the point.

00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:06.715 line:93%
We need to prevent Yoon Seo Won from talking.

00:13:09.114 --> 00:13:10.114 line:93%
Gosh.

00:13:10.784 --> 00:13:11.784 line:93%
(Boo Cheon)

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.624 line:93%
The number you have dialed isn't available at the moment...

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:19.165 line:93%
There's...

00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:22.994 line:93%
not one man I like in Mooshimwon.

00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:52.254 line:93%
The number you have dialed...

00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:54.024 line:93%
isn't available at the moment...

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:57.154 line:93%
He's still not picking up.

00:14:58.095 --> 00:14:59.595 line:93%
Something must've happened.

00:15:19.845 --> 00:15:20.854 line:93%
Mom.

00:15:21.784 --> 00:15:23.415 line:93%
Seo Won will not have...

00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:26.754 line:93%
- a press conference. - Really?

00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:30.654 line:93%
Did you talk her through?

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.095 line:93%
What did you say to change her mind?

00:15:35.494 --> 00:15:37.604 line:93%
I tried my best to beg her.

00:15:38.935 --> 00:15:40.335 line:93%
Then she said she won't do it.

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:43.305 line:93%
Good job, Boo Cheon.

00:15:44.874 --> 00:15:46.075 line:93%
Of course.

00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:48.144 line:93%
I'll become the chairman.

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:50.675 line:93%
That's nothing.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:56.284 line:93%
We should still lock her up for a while.

00:15:56.354 --> 00:15:59.425 line:93%
Mom. I've settled it.

00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:03.055 line:93%
Trust your son.

00:16:03.354 --> 00:16:04.725 line:93%
Gosh, Mom.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.634 line:93%
Sure.

00:16:10.734 --> 00:16:12.364 line:93%
I'll trust you...

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.205 line:93%
since you're so certain.

00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:19.244 line:93%
You two should go sleep.

00:16:33.524 --> 00:16:34.524 line:93%
Hey.

00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:36.955 line:93%
That knife...

00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:42.534 line:93%
I needed it to beg Seo Won.

00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:47.774 line:93%
I've put it back to its place.

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.604 line:93%
Don't blame me later if it goes missing.

00:16:53.774 --> 00:16:54.874 line:93%
Let's go to sleep.

00:16:56.244 --> 00:16:57.984 line:93%
You can relax, Mom.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:06.984 line:93%
Pil Joo.

00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:09.324 line:93%
Did Boo Cheon just...

00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:21.935 line:93%
(Yoon Seo Won)

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.744 line:93%
Yoon Seo Won's in Cheong A Hotel.

00:17:34.014 --> 00:17:35.254 line:93%
She's not answering her phone.

00:17:35.415 --> 00:17:37.855 line:93%
She must be sleeping. Do you know what time it is?

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:03.344 line:93%
Yoon Seo Won.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.685 line:93%
Yoon Seo Won.

00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:41.554 line:93%
(Mooshimwon)

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.554 line:93%
Did it work out?

00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:53.665 line:93%
That's a relief. I knew it.

00:18:53.794 --> 00:18:57.435 line:93%
She was just angry. She didn't really...

00:18:57.905 --> 00:19:00.365 line:93%
You should say hello if you're here.

00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:25.764 line:93%
Here.

00:19:34.034 --> 00:19:36.004 line:93%
I've used it since the day...

00:19:36.004 --> 00:19:38.605 line:93%
I started Cheong A business.

00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:40.105 line:93%
Grandfather.

00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:43.244 line:93%
I told him that you'd prefer...

00:19:43.244 --> 00:19:46.244 line:93%
receiving the shares or cash.

00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:49.715 line:93%
But he wanted to give it to you,

00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:52.355 line:93%
so he took it out a few days ago.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:55.324 line:93%
He even asked me to apply the lubricant on it...

00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:57.925 line:93%
and treat it as if it were a baby...

00:19:57.925 --> 00:19:59.425 line:93%
so that its beads won't fall off.

00:19:59.425 --> 00:20:02.465 line:93%
He was such a demanding man.

00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:04.734 line:93%
Are you disappointed that it's not the shares?

00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:07.304 line:93%
I am not, Grandfather.

00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:09.574 line:93%
I like it better than the shares.

00:20:10.844 --> 00:20:13.244 line:93%
Of course, I would've been happier if you gave me the shares too.

00:20:13.244 --> 00:20:17.314 line:93%
Look, this little boy now has grown into a decent man.

00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:19.915 line:93%
You're much better than your dad.

00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:24.425 line:93%
Sir, there's one more thing you should tell him.

00:20:24.584 --> 00:20:26.324 line:93%
- What? - You used the abacus...

00:20:26.324 --> 00:20:28.925 line:93%
in front of the customers...

00:20:28.925 --> 00:20:30.524 line:93%
just not to incur their suspicion.

00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:32.665 line:93%
But you were already done...

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:35.264 line:93%
calculating the prices in your head.

00:20:35.635 --> 00:20:36.895 line:93%
That's right.

00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:40.564 line:93%
I could do sums in my head faster than using it.

00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:42.605 line:93%
You're still the one...

00:20:42.605 --> 00:20:44.744 line:93%
who reads Cheong A's financial statements the fastest.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.774 line:93%
That's the vital aspect required for businessmen.

00:20:47.175 --> 00:20:50.514 line:93%
You need to know what would bring you the most profit quickly...

00:20:50.544 --> 00:20:53.185 line:93%
and then pretend not to know anything...

00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:54.355 line:93%
with a poker face.

00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:55.784 line:93%
With a poker face!

00:20:57.455 --> 00:20:58.554 line:93%
I got it.

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:00.554 line:93%
I'll keep that it mind.

00:21:00.554 --> 00:21:03.455 line:93%
I opened Cheong A business when I was 19,

00:21:03.455 --> 00:21:05.824 line:93%
so I guess the abacus is about 60 years old, right?

00:21:05.824 --> 00:21:07.395 line:93%
It'd be around 70 years old.

00:21:07.395 --> 00:21:08.764 line:93%
Really?

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.334 line:93%
I guess I want to rejuvenate myself...

00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:13.205 line:93%
since I often believe I'm younger than I really am.

00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:19.105 line:93%
Then Ha Jung will...

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:23.074 line:93%
lose his chance to become the member of the Jang family.

00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.215 line:93%
Boo Cheon begged me.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.324 line:93%
Call off Yoon Seo Won's press conference.

00:21:37.564 --> 00:21:38.594 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:57.544 line:93%
I didn't even know about its existence.

00:21:57.544 --> 00:21:58.615 line:93%
Grandfather...

00:21:59.014 --> 00:22:02.185 line:93%
only showed it to Dad just once and kept it until today.

00:22:02.554 --> 00:22:03.984 line:93%
And he gave it to me.

00:22:05.885 --> 00:22:09.094 line:93%
Attorney Kang and Director Jang have just got out of the hospital.

00:22:09.455 --> 00:22:11.195 line:93%
What would invigorate them?

00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:13.965 line:93%
What about Master Kwon's herbal tonic?

00:22:17.435 --> 00:22:20.304 line:93%
Ms. Na should have some more.

00:22:21.034 --> 00:22:22.074 line:93%
I'm all right.

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.605 line:93%
Mother, I don't need it.

00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:26.945 line:93%
You need it, so you can conceive a baby.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.215 line:93%
Director Jang even gave...

00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:31.344 line:93%
Ms. Na the family treasure.

00:22:32.244 --> 00:22:34.855 line:93%
Why don't you make Honorary Chairman Jan happy...

00:22:34.855 --> 00:22:36.185 line:93%
by giving birth to a baby boy?

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:37.925 line:93%
Family treasure?

00:22:38.054 --> 00:22:41.494 line:93%
I mean the necklace that the late vice chairman Jang had.

00:22:46.094 --> 00:22:49.395 line:93%
The necklace Honorary Chairman made himself...

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:51.804 line:93%
after winning some kind of bid for construction...

00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:55.274 line:93%
when the vice chairman was little.

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:00.074 line:93%
I have never seen it.

00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:05.314 line:93%
Then I'm sure Honorary Chairman Jang gave it to you.

00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:07.385 line:93%
I just found it somewhere else.

00:23:07.784 --> 00:23:08.855 line:93%
Really?

00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:11.984 line:93%
But it looked the same.

00:23:11.984 --> 00:23:13.225 line:93%
I know what it looks like.

00:23:14.254 --> 00:23:16.594 line:93%
Bring it here. I need to see it.

00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:18.764 line:93%
Yes, Mother.

00:23:38.115 --> 00:23:40.885 line:93%
It's inside the bottom drawer left to the desk.

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:12.084 line:93%
I found the place for Seo Won and Ha Jung to stay.

00:24:12.445 --> 00:24:15.814 line:93%
We need to estrange them from Boo Cheon for a while.

00:24:15.915 --> 00:24:18.984 line:93%
Finally, you have control over Yoon Seo Won.

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:25.665 line:93%
Why do you always cover up for her?

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:29.064 line:93%
There's no reason for it, Executive Jung.

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:30.494 line:93%
You never do anything...

00:24:31.264 --> 00:24:33.135 line:93%
without a reason.

00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.334 line:93%
I guess that means you can't tell me why.

00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:40.975 line:93%
Fine. I will stop asking why.

00:24:42.774 --> 00:24:46.544 line:93%
Boo Cheon could've changed so much thanks to your encouragement,

00:24:46.744 --> 00:24:47.984 line:93%
which is really good.

00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:51.855 line:93%
Both Boo Cheon and I think this would be the last chance.

00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:56.024 line:93%
Cheong A is currently under attack from others.

00:24:56.324 --> 00:24:59.195 line:93%
He thinks there would be no such chance later,

00:24:59.294 --> 00:25:01.465 line:93%
so he's been nervous a lot,

00:25:02.135 --> 00:25:05.405 line:93%
which I believe to be helpful for Boo Cheon.

00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:08.135 line:93%
I see.

00:25:44.344 --> 00:25:47.205 line:93%
Where did you find it?

00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:48.544 line:93%
I went to a retreat...

00:25:48.844 --> 00:25:51.145 line:93%
and found it near the river when I was young.

00:25:51.645 --> 00:25:53.844 line:93%
Where? Which river?

00:25:54.314 --> 00:25:56.855 line:93%
It was near the retreat center in Gapyeong.

00:26:02.824 --> 00:26:03.955 line:93%
Leave it here.

00:26:08.395 --> 00:26:09.895 line:93%
It's not yours.

00:26:10.665 --> 00:26:12.465 line:93%
Do you cherish it now?

00:26:19.504 --> 00:26:22.074 line:93%
This belong to the Jangs,

00:26:23.044 --> 00:26:24.544 line:93%
specifically to my husband.

00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:26.514 line:93%
Let me make it clear...

00:26:27.115 --> 00:26:28.584 line:93%
that it's mine, Mo Hyun.

00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:35.994 line:93%
I'll give it to you when you give birth to a baby.

00:26:40.294 --> 00:26:41.494 line:93%
You may leave.

00:26:45.034 --> 00:26:46.064 line:93%
Okay.

00:26:55.915 --> 00:26:56.975 line:93%
This necklace is...

00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:00.344 line:93%
the late Eun Cheon's.

00:27:04.484 --> 00:27:06.655 line:93%
He put it inside a frame and treasured it,

00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:09.655 line:93%
saying it was from his father.

00:27:10.094 --> 00:27:11.465 line:93%
And one day, he took it out...

00:27:12.195 --> 00:27:14.195 line:93%
and put it around Eun Cheon's neck.

00:27:16.564 --> 00:27:18.734 line:93%
It must've be given to Boo Cheon.

00:27:25.405 --> 00:27:26.875 line:93%
It's so strange.

00:27:27.774 --> 00:27:29.215 line:93%
How could it fall...

00:27:30.514 --> 00:27:32.514 line:93%
into Mo Hyun's hands?

00:27:36.084 --> 00:27:38.824 line:93%
We not only failed to get the permit to build Cheong A Tower,

00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:41.355 line:93%
but also Boo Cheon's father-in-law failed to become the president.

00:27:42.195 --> 00:27:43.225 line:93%
Since...

00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:46.165 line:93%
Mo Hyun became our family,

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.234 line:93%
nothing has gone well at all.

00:27:49.264 --> 00:27:51.165 line:93%
During the five years of Lee Cheol Yong's presidency,

00:27:51.264 --> 00:27:53.534 line:93%
Cheong A has earned a great deal of profits...

00:27:53.734 --> 00:27:56.635 line:93%
thanks to Congressman Na's lobbying.

00:27:58.405 --> 00:28:00.915 line:93%
And because of the profit we gained during the current administration,

00:28:01.074 --> 00:28:04.514 line:93%
the next government is paying attention to us.

00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:08.784 line:93%
Pil Joo,

00:28:10.314 --> 00:28:13.425 line:93%
you always take Mo Hyun's side whenever we talk about her,

00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:16.655 line:93%
and that's awfully unpleasant.

00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:22.665 line:93%
You're not working for her sake.

00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:24.665 line:93%
Come to yourself,

00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:26.304 line:93%
Pil Joo.

00:28:32.804 --> 00:28:34.544 line:93%
Out of nine candidates for the vice chairman,

00:28:34.544 --> 00:28:37.484 line:93%
we've narrowed down to five candidates...

00:28:37.484 --> 00:28:40.284 line:93%
including Vice President Jang and Director Jang.

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:41.754 line:93%
Here it is.

00:28:43.514 --> 00:28:46.054 line:93%
The presidents selected the candidates.

00:28:46.484 --> 00:28:48.024 line:93%
I am sure...

00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:51.425 line:93%
all of them are qualified enough as you chose them.

00:28:51.994 --> 00:28:53.264 line:93%
I never doubt it.

00:28:53.794 --> 00:28:56.594 line:93%
As long as it's motivated Boo Cheon and Yeo Cheon, it's good.

00:28:59.234 --> 00:29:02.074 line:93%
Then let's narrow down to Boo Cheon and Yeo Cheon...

00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:04.445 line:93%
and brief me on them.

00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:06.405 line:93%
As you all know,

00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:09.014 line:93%
the new treatment Director Jang developed...

00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:10.675 line:93%
successfully garnered the media's attention.

00:29:13.115 --> 00:29:15.314 line:93%
However, Vice President Jang Yeo Cheon...

00:29:15.314 --> 00:29:17.784 line:93%
violated Director Jang Boo Cheon's privacy...

00:29:17.784 --> 00:29:18.955 line:93%
Mr. Woo.

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.324 line:93%
That's enough.

00:29:22.955 --> 00:29:25.865 line:93%
But I'm obliged to report it...

00:29:25.994 --> 00:29:28.365 line:93%
as the head of the personnel committee.

00:29:28.895 --> 00:29:29.965 line:93%
Attorney Kang.

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:33.605 line:93%
Mr. Woo, it's all over already. You don't need to report it.

00:29:33.734 --> 00:29:35.834 line:93%
How come there's something I do not know?

00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:39.044 line:93%
Attorney Kang, how dare you treat me...

00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:40.814 line:93%
like a lame duck?

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:42.074 line:93%
I apologize, sir.

00:29:43.344 --> 00:29:46.814 line:93%
Director Jang Boo Cheon took care of it,

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:48.655 line:93%
so I didn't inform you.

00:29:48.715 --> 00:29:49.885 line:93%
Tell me now.

00:29:51.155 --> 00:29:54.254 line:93%
Director Jang Yeo Cheon appeased the mother of Yoon Ha Jung,

00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:55.994 line:93%
the child you met a while ago,

00:29:56.794 --> 00:29:59.324 line:93%
with the promise that he'd support her with a suit against...

00:29:59.895 --> 00:30:02.264 line:93%
Director Jang Boo Cheon regarding the paternity...

00:30:02.435 --> 00:30:04.764 line:93%
of the child if she holds a press conference.

00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:06.504 line:93%
However,

00:30:07.534 --> 00:30:08.774 line:93%
the purpose of the press conference...

00:30:09.504 --> 00:30:12.744 line:93%
was to mar the reputation of Director Jang Boo Cheon, sir.

00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:16.475 line:93%
Yeo Cheon.

00:30:17.014 --> 00:30:20.445 line:93%
You are disrupting everything that brings profits to me.

00:30:20.584 --> 00:30:22.484 line:93%
- Grandfather. - Yeo Cheon...

00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:24.425 line:93%
will exempted from the potential vice chairman list.

00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:28.225 line:93%
- Yes, sir. - And Yeo Cheon.

00:30:28.824 --> 00:30:29.824 line:93%
Yes, Grandfather.

00:30:29.824 --> 00:30:32.165 line:93%
You will be able to control your mind better...

00:30:32.165 --> 00:30:33.725 line:93%
once you work on cutting down the trees in Myanmar.

00:30:34.494 --> 00:30:36.695 line:93%
- Work there for two years. - Grandfather.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:51.719 line:93%
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E17 Money Flower "Cheong A's Dog"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

00:31:01.494 --> 00:31:03.824 line:93%
Why didn't you tell Grandfather that...

00:31:04.494 --> 00:31:06.564 line:93%
Yeo Cheon tried to get Seo Won to hold a press conference?

00:31:09.365 --> 00:31:11.635 line:93%
Yeo Cheon doesn't live at Mooshimwon.

00:31:13.365 --> 00:31:16.534 line:93%
Yeo Cheon had to be present when I told him about it,

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.645 line:93%
so your grandfather could get angrier...

00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:21.915 line:93%
seeing Yeo Cheon sitting in front of him.

00:31:22.744 --> 00:31:25.984 line:93%
That's how we can get rid of him faster.

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:28.915 line:93%
So...

00:31:30.685 --> 00:31:33.625 line:93%
to get rid of him with one blow, Mr. Woo set up the stage,

00:31:34.395 --> 00:31:36.494 line:93%
you danced on the stage while pretending to be clueless,

00:31:37.225 --> 00:31:38.965 line:93%
and Grandfather played along with the whole act.

00:31:43.294 --> 00:31:45.534 line:93%
Gosh, Pil Joo. Well played.

00:31:49.004 --> 00:31:50.074 line:93%
But now that...

00:31:50.905 --> 00:31:53.405 line:93%
Yeo Cheon is leaving to the lumber camp in Myanmar,

00:31:54.915 --> 00:31:56.744 line:93%
I sort of feel bad for him.

00:32:00.715 --> 00:32:01.754 line:93%
Boo Cheon.

00:32:08.254 --> 00:32:09.254 line:93%
Jang Boo Cheon.

00:32:11.564 --> 00:32:13.365 line:93%
You didn't win yet.

00:32:16.465 --> 00:32:19.465 line:93%
You don't have time to wallow in your feelings.

00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.175 line:93%
If Jang Yeo Cheon...

00:32:22.175 --> 00:32:23.375 line:93%
stays next to you,

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:25.804 line:93%
he will try to take you down whenever he gets a chance.

00:32:26.645 --> 00:32:28.475 line:93%
He can steal your position from you.

00:32:30.784 --> 00:32:31.885 line:93%
Keep that in mind.

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:34.355 line:93%
Okay?

00:32:40.084 --> 00:32:41.125 line:93%
Okay.

00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:43.294 line:93%
I got it.

00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:48.865 line:93%
Hey.

00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:51.205 line:93%
Just punch me.

00:32:52.034 --> 00:32:53.064 line:93%
You...

00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:56.534 line:93%
Do you know how scary you look when you shoot daggers at me?

00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:03.875 line:93%
You wouldn't know. You've never looked at your own eyes.

00:33:16.824 --> 00:33:18.294 line:93%
Are you here to say goodbye?

00:33:20.324 --> 00:33:21.494 line:93%
There's no need for that.

00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:25.034 line:93%
I'm not a fan of you,

00:33:25.534 --> 00:33:27.435 line:93%
but since we share the lineage,

00:33:28.004 --> 00:33:30.274 line:93%
chalk it up to our lineage, and let me give you a word of advice.

00:33:31.574 --> 00:33:33.905 line:93%
I guess today is my day of receiving advice.

00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:36.645 line:93%
Why does everyone who has a mouth around me...

00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:38.645 line:93%
want to give a word of advice?

00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:40.715 line:93%
Every advice, but mine, doesn't mean anything.

00:33:41.054 --> 00:33:43.814 line:93%
This advice from your competitor is real.

00:33:45.925 --> 00:33:47.385 line:93%
Be careful with Kang Pil Joo.

00:33:48.494 --> 00:33:50.195 line:93%
He can push you away anytime...

00:33:50.254 --> 00:33:51.895 line:93%
and take your place.

00:33:52.064 --> 00:33:53.125 line:93%
Hey, punk.

00:33:53.695 --> 00:33:57.234 line:93%
Didn't you hear how Pil Joo addressed me as his "owner"?

00:33:57.865 --> 00:33:59.665 line:93%
How dare you cause a rift between us?

00:34:01.804 --> 00:34:02.975 line:93%
How naive.

00:34:03.905 --> 00:34:07.244 line:93%
Do you think he genuinely sees you as his superior?

00:34:07.415 --> 00:34:09.815 line:93%
Hey, get out. These days,

00:34:10.844 --> 00:34:12.415 line:93%
I'm working on my reputation.

00:34:13.045 --> 00:34:15.485 line:93%
Count yourself lucky that I'm not beating you up. Get lost.

00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:20.424 line:93%
I told you to get out!

00:34:30.964 --> 00:34:34.435 line:93%
It is my opinion that the biggest mistake Aunt made...

00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:37.404 line:93%
is keeping Kang Pil Joo next to you.

00:34:38.904 --> 00:34:41.514 line:93%
When we were young, we used to play together all the time.

00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:43.475 line:93%
I know enough about you.

00:34:45.045 --> 00:34:46.815 line:93%
You're not as weak as...

00:34:47.415 --> 00:34:49.214 line:93%
Aunt makes you out to be.

00:34:50.514 --> 00:34:52.025 line:93%
Without Kang Pil Joo,

00:34:52.185 --> 00:34:54.625 line:93%
you could have competed against me.

00:34:55.654 --> 00:34:57.025 line:93%
Fair and square.

00:34:58.264 --> 00:35:00.565 line:93%
Am I not playing fair now?

00:35:03.065 --> 00:35:04.105 line:93%
Boo Cheon.

00:35:04.904 --> 00:35:07.235 line:93%
You got all the way here because...

00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:09.574 line:93%
Kang Pil Joo trained you.

00:35:15.145 --> 00:35:18.545 line:93%
Do you really not know or are you playing dumb with me?

00:35:19.485 --> 00:35:22.255 line:93%
- You jerk. - Should I...

00:35:23.585 --> 00:35:25.185 line:93%
guess what you're thinking?

00:35:26.955 --> 00:35:30.225 line:93%
You often think that you're lucky to have Kang Pil Joo on your side,

00:35:30.424 --> 00:35:31.824 line:93%
don't you?

00:35:35.264 --> 00:35:36.264 line:93%
Good luck.

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:38.505 line:93%
Don't let the tiger bite you.

00:35:38.964 --> 00:35:40.065 line:93%
Survive.

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.205 line:93%
Please do.

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.864 line:93%
Get all the files...

00:36:12.304 --> 00:36:15.074 line:93%
that you collected while tailing Ms. Na ready.

00:36:15.634 --> 00:36:18.844 line:93%
Are you really going to tell her everything about her marriage?

00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:21.174 line:93%
Yes, except the part Congressman Na willingly made use...

00:36:21.415 --> 00:36:23.014 line:93%
of the support from Cheong A.

00:36:23.744 --> 00:36:25.315 line:93%
I'll be the only one to blame.

00:36:25.685 --> 00:36:28.085 line:93%
Ms. Na and Congressman Na...

00:36:28.685 --> 00:36:31.185 line:93%
- will be the victims. - Pil Joo.

00:36:32.355 --> 00:36:34.255 line:93%
Are you trying to make her hate you...

00:36:34.654 --> 00:36:36.525 line:93%
and put distance from you?

00:36:36.525 --> 00:36:39.795 line:93%
- How are stocks for this quarter? - Well,

00:36:40.994 --> 00:36:44.105 line:93%
we lost the funds when President Jang Seong Man stole the truck,

00:36:44.534 --> 00:36:46.065 line:93%
but we recovered the funds with the stocks.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.475 line:93%
We had a great quarter with the stock investment.

00:36:48.534 --> 00:36:51.645 line:93%
When Daeil Distribution goes public, we will need fund to buy shares.

00:36:51.804 --> 00:36:55.244 line:93%
Stop purchasing stocks of Cheong A Trading for a while.

00:36:55.844 --> 00:36:58.915 line:93%
- Okay. - Buy a lot of shares from Daeil.

00:36:59.045 --> 00:37:01.154 line:93%
That's how we will have the upper hand...

00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:03.355 line:93%
when Cheong A Bio and Cheong A Trading merge.

00:37:03.355 --> 00:37:05.284 line:93%
But Cheong A Trading is a bigger company.

00:37:05.855 --> 00:37:08.654 line:93%
Even the merging ratio will be advantageous for Cheong A Trading.

00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:11.625 line:93%
For now, yes. But keep your tabs on it.

00:37:12.165 --> 00:37:14.594 line:93%
It's a matter of time for Cheong A Bio to take over Cheong A Trading.

00:37:16.864 --> 00:37:18.534 line:93%
With the money from Executive Jung,

00:37:18.665 --> 00:37:21.505 line:93%
buy shares of Cheong A Trading. With our money,

00:37:21.735 --> 00:37:24.005 line:93%
only buy shares of Cheong A Bio which is undervalued.

00:37:24.074 --> 00:37:26.344 line:93%
Buy expensive shares with Executive Jung's money.

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:27.915 line:93%
Cheap ones with our money.

00:37:29.045 --> 00:37:30.815 line:93%
Okay. Got it.

00:37:42.355 --> 00:37:43.355 line:93%
Pil Joo.

00:38:11.784 --> 00:38:12.784 line:93%
Park Yong Goo.

00:38:26.034 --> 00:38:27.065 line:93%
So this is...

00:38:28.134 --> 00:38:31.045 line:93%
the headquarters where you are striving to make me...

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:32.705 line:93%
the chairman.

00:38:34.005 --> 00:38:35.145 line:93%
What brings you here?

00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:39.514 line:93%
I came here for you.

00:38:40.915 --> 00:38:42.085 line:93%
I had some questions.

00:38:44.485 --> 00:38:47.355 line:93%
I asked Pil Joo about this, but he didn't give me an answer.

00:38:47.955 --> 00:38:49.054 line:93%
Pil Joo.

00:38:50.924 --> 00:38:52.625 line:93%
Do you know what he plans to do...

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.735 line:93%
once I become the chairman?

00:38:56.034 --> 00:38:59.065 line:93%
He will still work at Cheong A. When you become the chairman,

00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:02.034 line:93%
aren't you going to promote him?

00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:03.404 line:93%
Of course.

00:39:04.244 --> 00:39:05.804 line:93%
I should make him the president...

00:39:06.674 --> 00:39:08.975 line:93%
of a subsidiary or something. That's for sure.

00:39:11.244 --> 00:39:12.744 line:93%
Help him.

00:39:13.344 --> 00:39:14.415 line:93%
That's how...

00:39:15.784 --> 00:39:17.424 line:93%
you can help me.

00:39:17.884 --> 00:39:19.455 line:93%
I will return the favor later.

00:39:20.455 --> 00:39:21.625 line:93%
Sure.

00:39:22.395 --> 00:39:23.455 line:93%
Actually,

00:39:24.054 --> 00:39:27.264 line:93%
time to time, I sold myself short and wondered...

00:39:28.565 --> 00:39:31.665 line:93%
what good being the chairman of Cheong A would do for me.

00:39:34.804 --> 00:39:37.475 line:93%
Hey, this is just between you and me.

00:39:38.475 --> 00:39:40.645 line:93%
I didn't even want to become the chairman,

00:39:40.674 --> 00:39:43.244 line:93%
but Pil Joo tamed and trained me.

00:39:44.344 --> 00:39:46.214 line:93%
That's how he's been dragging me until now.

00:39:49.514 --> 00:39:51.554 line:93%
He was just helping out as a friend.

00:39:52.585 --> 00:39:53.855 line:93%
You are being too harsh.

00:39:53.855 --> 00:39:56.424 line:93%
That's why I'm telling you this is between us.

00:39:58.364 --> 00:39:59.824 line:93%
It's also true, isn't it?

00:40:42.534 --> 00:40:43.574 line:93%
Secretary Oh.

00:40:45.705 --> 00:40:46.875 line:93%
Were you waiting for me?

00:40:47.304 --> 00:40:50.475 line:93%
No, I wasn't. It's not like that.

00:40:51.344 --> 00:40:53.284 line:93%
You come home around this time,

00:40:53.744 --> 00:40:56.485 line:93%
so I was just standing near here while I was taking a walk.

00:41:02.994 --> 00:41:03.994 line:93%
Secretary Oh.

00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:05.494 line:93%
Yes.

00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:07.565 line:93%
Don't wait for me anymore.

00:41:08.964 --> 00:41:10.065 line:93%
It's really awkward.

00:41:13.134 --> 00:41:14.375 line:93%
Yes, sir.

00:41:31.955 --> 00:41:34.455 line:93%
Mo Hyun said she'll be at her parents' place a little longer.

00:41:34.455 --> 00:41:36.395 line:93%
Okay. I heard too.

00:41:37.424 --> 00:41:39.324 line:93%
- I had dinner already. - Okay.

00:41:42.435 --> 00:41:43.694 line:93%
What happened to the necklace?

00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:47.505 line:93%
I heard I saw it correctly.

00:41:49.634 --> 00:41:50.634 line:93%
Mom.

00:42:05.924 --> 00:42:06.955 line:93%
I...

00:42:08.424 --> 00:42:11.895 line:93%
know Dad had another son.

00:42:13.994 --> 00:42:15.134 line:93%
That necklace...

00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:20.165 line:93%
was given to Jang Eun Cheon by Dad, right?

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:22.634 line:93%
That's right.

00:42:24.205 --> 00:42:26.205 line:93%
But Mo Hyun picked that up.

00:42:30.315 --> 00:42:31.344 line:93%
Show it to me.

00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:33.744 line:93%
Why would you want to see it?

00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:35.815 line:93%
A dead person wore that.

00:42:36.915 --> 00:42:39.284 line:93%
Jang Eun Cheon is dead.

00:42:40.924 --> 00:42:41.955 line:93%
I know.

00:42:42.525 --> 00:42:43.694 line:93%
I heard he's dead.

00:42:49.964 --> 00:42:51.134 line:93%
But I still want to see it.

00:42:52.705 --> 00:42:54.735 line:93%
I want to see the necklace that Dad gave to Jang Eun Cheon.

00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:23.094 line:93%
Grandfather gave it to your dad.

00:43:25.404 --> 00:43:27.335 line:93%
And it should've been passed to you.

00:43:42.815 --> 00:43:43.815 line:93%
Mom.

00:43:45.525 --> 00:43:46.755 line:93%
I want to keep it.

00:43:48.355 --> 00:43:49.424 line:93%
Okay.

00:43:50.025 --> 00:43:51.525 line:93%
That'd be better.

00:43:54.494 --> 00:43:55.835 line:93%
The necklace...

00:43:56.235 --> 00:43:58.034 line:93%
has finally found its rightful owner,

00:43:58.935 --> 00:44:00.134 line:93%
thanks to Mo Hyun.

00:44:23.725 --> 00:44:24.824 line:93%
Sir.

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:41.975 line:93%
Secretary Oh.

00:44:44.844 --> 00:44:45.884 line:93%
You...

00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:48.955 line:93%
went and took care...

00:44:50.514 --> 00:44:52.554 line:93%
of Jang Eun Cheon's funeral with Pil Joo and mom, right?

00:44:56.494 --> 00:44:57.924 line:93%
I heard it from Pil Joo.

00:44:58.964 --> 00:45:00.625 line:93%
Yes.

00:45:02.895 --> 00:45:04.134 line:93%
But Secretary Oh.

00:45:10.705 --> 00:45:11.744 line:93%
Actually,

00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:17.014 line:93%
Jang Eun Cheon is alive.

00:45:19.815 --> 00:45:21.514 line:93%
What do you...

00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:27.625 line:93%
Kang Pil Joo...

00:45:29.355 --> 00:45:31.295 line:93%
is Jang Eun Cheon, Secretary Oh.

00:45:31.994 --> 00:45:33.194 line:93%
Sir.

00:45:36.335 --> 00:45:37.335 line:93%
I...

00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:39.404 line:93%
My mom...

00:45:42.235 --> 00:45:45.505 line:93%
He knows how much my mom and I like him.

00:45:47.415 --> 00:45:49.975 line:93%
We've been deceived for over 20 years.

00:45:54.045 --> 00:45:56.855 line:93%
What grudges must he have against us?

00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:59.455 line:93%
How could he...

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.165 line:93%
deceive us for such a long time?

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.364 line:93%
So...

00:46:10.295 --> 00:46:12.864 line:93%
please keep an eye on Pil Joo.

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.074 line:93%
Okay.

00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:18.344 line:93%
Don't tell...

00:46:20.145 --> 00:46:21.875 line:93%
my mom about this.

00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:23.415 line:93%
Of course.

00:46:24.244 --> 00:46:25.415 line:93%
I won't.

00:46:32.525 --> 00:46:33.654 line:93%
If my mom finds out...

00:46:37.864 --> 00:46:39.565 line:93%
that Pil Joo's been deceiving her,

00:46:43.694 --> 00:46:45.404 line:93%
she might pass away.

00:47:07.594 --> 00:47:09.324 line:93%
When is Yeo Cheon leaving?

00:47:10.225 --> 00:47:13.364 line:93%
Since those in Myanmar need to get ready for him,

00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:15.065 line:93%
he'll leave in about 10 days.

00:47:16.464 --> 00:47:19.605 line:93%
So it'll take 10 more days until we finally get rid of him.

00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:23.275 line:93%
Jang Seong Man.

00:47:23.935 --> 00:47:27.105 line:93%
He won't come begging because he's too proud.

00:47:28.114 --> 00:47:31.884 line:93%
He must be dying to receive a call...

00:47:31.884 --> 00:47:33.585 line:93%
from Father.

00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:39.985 line:93%
One more thing, Pil Joo.

00:47:41.855 --> 00:47:44.264 line:93%
About the necklace that Mo Hyun picked up.

00:47:45.764 --> 00:47:49.295 line:93%
Wouldn't it make more sense...

00:47:50.094 --> 00:47:52.964 line:93%
to say Eun Cheon gave it to her...

00:47:53.964 --> 00:47:57.574 line:93%
than saying she picked it up coincidentally at a school trip?

00:47:58.505 --> 00:48:00.304 line:93%
Wouldn't that sound more believable?

00:48:02.545 --> 00:48:04.244 line:93%
She kept the necklace...

00:48:04.344 --> 00:48:07.085 line:93%
she picked up coincidentally for more than 20 years?

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:09.755 line:93%
It's better...

00:48:10.355 --> 00:48:12.355 line:93%
to say that there's something...

00:48:13.324 --> 00:48:15.755 line:93%
between Jang Eun Cheon and Na Mo Hyun.

00:48:18.525 --> 00:48:19.694 line:93%
Earlier,

00:48:20.225 --> 00:48:22.634 line:93%
she seemed attached...

00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:25.505 line:93%
to the necklace...

00:48:26.264 --> 00:48:28.574 line:93%
when I said that I'll keep it.

00:48:31.505 --> 00:48:34.714 line:93%
It was also near Gapyeong...

00:48:35.114 --> 00:48:38.214 line:93%
where Ahn Ho Kyung jumped into the water with his two sons.

00:48:39.415 --> 00:48:40.514 line:93%
Mo Hyun...

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:42.685 line:93%
picked up Jang Eun Cheon's necklace...

00:48:43.884 --> 00:48:47.795 line:93%
during her school trip near Gapyeong.

00:48:53.924 --> 00:48:54.964 line:93%
Wait.

00:48:56.694 --> 00:48:58.304 line:93%
Pil Joo, your house...

00:48:59.034 --> 00:49:00.304 line:93%
is also in Gapyeong.

00:49:23.194 --> 00:49:24.565 line:93%
Gosh, this feels good.

00:49:24.565 --> 00:49:26.665 line:93%
You did a great job today.

00:49:26.665 --> 00:49:29.235 line:93%
I was so busy today.

00:49:29.235 --> 00:49:31.065 line:93%
I didn't have much time to sit down.

00:49:31.065 --> 00:49:32.735 line:93%
Selling food...

00:49:33.205 --> 00:49:36.475 line:93%
is getting money from others' pockets.

00:49:36.775 --> 00:49:38.944 line:93%
It's the most difficult...

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:40.744 line:93%
and noble task.

00:49:41.014 --> 00:49:42.214 line:93%
Of course, you're tired.

00:49:42.415 --> 00:49:43.545 line:93%
It's noble.

00:49:43.545 --> 00:49:46.315 line:93%
I always keep what you said in mind,

00:49:46.384 --> 00:49:47.614 line:93%
and when there are guests,

00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:51.284 line:93%
I serve them as if they're...

00:49:51.485 --> 00:49:53.154 line:93%
my late parents.

00:49:53.554 --> 00:49:55.054 line:93%
That's a good attitude.

00:49:58.395 --> 00:49:59.395 line:93%
Oh, it's nice.

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:11.744 line:93%
Father. It's us.

00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:17.685 line:93%
(Mooshimwon)

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:33.525 line:93%
Keep the conversation between Seong Man and me...

00:50:33.694 --> 00:50:35.194 line:93%
well.

00:50:35.194 --> 00:50:37.735 line:93%
Yes, sir. I'll record it.

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:44.174 line:93%
Father. We don't need an attorney...

00:50:44.505 --> 00:50:46.444 line:93%
for the family matter.

00:50:46.444 --> 00:50:48.645 line:93%
You still have a far way to go.

00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:51.045 line:93%
This isn't a family matter.

00:50:51.645 --> 00:50:53.315 line:93%
You're demoted to the lumber camp...

00:50:53.315 --> 00:50:55.315 line:93%
as a punishment for harming Cheong A.

00:50:57.585 --> 00:50:59.955 line:93%
What do you want to nitpick at?

00:50:59.955 --> 00:51:01.225 line:93%
Don't be like that.

00:51:01.955 --> 00:51:03.654 line:93%
I'm here to apologize.

00:51:22.514 --> 00:51:23.514 line:93%
Father.

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:25.714 line:93%
I...

00:51:26.384 --> 00:51:28.955 line:93%
will back off,

00:51:30.685 --> 00:51:33.054 line:93%
but please forgive Yeo Cheon.

00:51:35.554 --> 00:51:39.194 line:93%
This won't solve anything.

00:51:39.725 --> 00:51:42.665 line:93%
Attorney Kang. Why don't you stay mutual...

00:51:43.134 --> 00:51:45.005 line:93%
and suggest a plan for Cheong A?

00:51:45.705 --> 00:51:49.735 line:93%
It's cost a lot of money and time...

00:51:50.005 --> 00:51:52.145 line:93%
to prevent the public from knowing...

00:51:52.645 --> 00:51:55.074 line:93%
what Director Jang Yeo Cheon has done wrong.

00:51:56.145 --> 00:51:59.344 line:93%
Many people say his relegation...

00:51:59.915 --> 00:52:02.784 line:93%
has set a good example to management.

00:52:03.455 --> 00:52:04.554 line:93%
If...

00:52:04.924 --> 00:52:07.694 line:93%
his relegation is canceled,

00:52:08.554 --> 00:52:10.594 line:93%
I believe it is an action against...

00:52:10.725 --> 00:52:12.594 line:93%
Honorary Chairman's belief...

00:52:12.964 --> 00:52:15.194 line:93%
of making anyone who harms Cheong A...

00:52:15.264 --> 00:52:17.065 line:93%
take responsibility.

00:52:22.074 --> 00:52:24.444 line:93%
- Yeo Cheon. - Yes, Grandfather.

00:52:24.705 --> 00:52:27.145 line:93%
It's against my belief.

00:52:27.475 --> 00:52:28.744 line:93%
I can't take it back.

00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:31.485 line:93%
Go work at the lumber camp.

00:52:45.964 --> 00:52:46.964 line:93%
How did...

00:52:48.264 --> 00:52:49.264 line:93%
three of us...

00:52:51.205 --> 00:52:53.835 line:93%
get on the wrong path?

00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:00.674 line:93%
It's your turn to answer me now.

00:53:22.935 --> 00:53:24.904 line:93%
- Hello? - Boo Cheon.

00:53:25.705 --> 00:53:28.134 line:93%
- I'm sorry, - About what?

00:53:28.804 --> 00:53:31.875 line:93%
but I'm going to tell Ms. Na...

00:53:33.045 --> 00:53:35.344 line:93%
that your marriage was my idea.

00:53:36.614 --> 00:53:37.744 line:93%
I thought...

00:53:38.145 --> 00:53:40.714 line:93%
I should tell you...

00:53:41.755 --> 00:53:43.585 line:93%
- before I tell her. - what?

00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:46.085 line:93%
Are you out of your mind?

00:53:47.494 --> 00:53:48.594 line:93%
Don't do that.

00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:50.295 line:93%
Hey...

00:53:52.694 --> 00:53:54.534 line:93%
What a jerk.

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:10.214 line:93%
- Hello, Director Kang. - Long time no see.

00:54:12.045 --> 00:54:13.685 line:93%
Where's Executive Na?

00:54:13.685 --> 00:54:16.255 line:93%
She went out for lunch at the restaurant in front of the building.

00:54:18.525 --> 00:54:21.054 line:93%
(Bonjuk and Bibimbap Cafe)

00:54:27.094 --> 00:54:28.094 line:93%
Ms. Na.

00:54:29.594 --> 00:54:30.735 line:93%
Mr. Kang.

00:54:32.005 --> 00:54:33.464 line:93%
What are you doing here?

00:54:33.964 --> 00:54:35.074 line:93%
Can I sit down?

00:54:36.005 --> 00:54:37.034 line:93%
Yes.

00:54:42.275 --> 00:54:43.944 line:93%
How is working in the foundation?

00:54:45.384 --> 00:54:47.585 line:93%
It's not as fun as teaching,

00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:49.255 line:93%
but I'm getting used to it.

00:54:49.585 --> 00:54:50.585 line:93%
That's nice to hear.

00:54:51.654 --> 00:54:53.054 line:93%
Would you like to order?

00:54:53.884 --> 00:54:55.924 line:93%
- This one please. - Yes.

00:55:02.835 --> 00:55:04.464 line:93%
(Jang Boo Cheon)

00:55:08.134 --> 00:55:10.174 line:93%
(Boo Cheon)

00:55:10.634 --> 00:55:11.674 line:93%
Ms. Na.

00:55:12.574 --> 00:55:15.074 line:93%
One second.

00:55:18.344 --> 00:55:19.685 line:93%
(Boo Cheon)

00:55:20.415 --> 00:55:22.654 line:93%
He knows that...

00:55:23.585 --> 00:55:24.824 line:93%
I'm here to talk to you.

00:55:33.094 --> 00:55:35.735 line:93%
- Eat. - Enjoy.

00:57:24.404 --> 00:57:25.404 line:93%
Have a seat.

00:57:40.725 --> 00:57:41.725 line:93%
You said...

00:57:42.355 --> 00:57:44.694 line:93%
you'll take back what you said about...

00:57:46.665 --> 00:57:48.235 line:93%
me living well.

00:57:52.464 --> 00:57:53.864 line:93%
After you listen to me,

00:57:55.174 --> 00:57:56.634 line:93%
you'll regret...

00:57:58.145 --> 00:57:59.674 line:93%
saving my life.

00:59:27.665 --> 00:59:28.665 line:93%
Did you know...

00:59:30.065 --> 00:59:31.835 line:93%
people call me...

00:59:36.904 --> 00:59:37.944 line:93%
Cheong A's dog?

00:59:42.415 --> 00:59:44.185 line:93%
My goal for Cheong A...

00:59:45.514 --> 00:59:46.645 line:93%
is to make...

00:59:48.114 --> 00:59:49.315 line:93%
my owner,

00:59:50.214 --> 00:59:52.154 line:93%
Jang Boo Cheon, the chairman.

00:59:55.924 --> 00:59:57.725 line:93%
In order for him to become the chairman,

00:59:59.565 --> 01:00:02.534 line:93%
he has to win Honorary Chairman Jang's heart.

01:00:03.964 --> 01:00:06.764 line:93%
Honorary Chairman Jang's lifelong dream was...

01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:11.804 line:93%
to earn the approval for Cheong A Tower construction.

01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:13.475 line:93%
So I thought...

01:00:14.145 --> 01:00:16.344 line:93%
the daughter of Congressman Na Gi Chul,

01:00:18.085 --> 01:00:19.114 line:93%
the presidential candidate,

01:00:19.944 --> 01:00:22.485 line:93%
would be perfect...

01:00:23.685 --> 01:00:24.924 line:93%
as Boo Cheon's match.

01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:28.094 line:93%
So...

01:00:34.335 --> 01:00:35.735 line:93%
it was planned...

01:00:40.364 --> 01:00:41.375 line:93%
from the beginning...

01:00:43.935 --> 01:00:44.975 line:93%
Right.

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.304 line:93%
That is correct.

01:00:55.514 --> 01:00:56.585 line:93%
The reason I stayed around you...

01:00:57.384 --> 01:00:59.955 line:93%
wasn't because I liked you,

01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:03.654 line:93%
but because...

01:01:04.295 --> 01:01:05.625 line:93%
I needed to investigate you.

01:01:09.494 --> 01:01:10.594 line:93%
And...

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:17.034 line:93%
I came to have feelings for you.

01:01:30.085 --> 01:01:31.255 line:93%
But now,

01:01:33.154 --> 01:01:35.324 line:93%
I no longer like you.

01:01:40.694 --> 01:01:41.735 line:93%
You met Boo Cheon,

01:01:42.864 --> 01:01:44.764 line:93%
fell in love with him,

01:01:46.134 --> 01:01:47.735 line:93%
and got married...

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.034 line:93%
according to the scenario...

01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:52.505 line:93%
I wrote.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.784 line:93%
I shot the wing of the bird,

01:01:58.714 --> 01:01:59.915 line:93%
and Boo Cheon...

01:02:01.014 --> 01:02:04.284 line:93%
succeeded in getting close to you...

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:07.824 line:93%
very naturally...

01:02:10.154 --> 01:02:11.395 line:93%
by rescuing the bird.

01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:12.585 line:93%
What are you doing?

01:03:13.025 --> 01:03:14.395 line:93%
Please stop!

01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:31.475 line:93%
There was someone who must've been blamed,

01:03:34.614 --> 01:03:36.674 line:93%
but I criticized the wrong person.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.924 line:93%
Let go of my hands. Get off.

01:03:51.464 --> 01:03:52.594 line:93%
Let go!

01:03:52.864 --> 01:03:53.994 line:93%
Let go!

01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:02.775 line:93%
Do you know how terrified I was...

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.375 line:93%
when I saved you?

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.514 line:93%
I was afraid to lose you.

01:04:16.014 --> 01:04:17.424 line:93%
I was afraid to find you dead...

01:04:20.855 --> 01:04:22.255 line:93%
when I took you out.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:28.565 line:93%
I prayed...

01:04:30.904 --> 01:04:32.464 line:93%
for strength,

01:04:35.435 --> 01:04:37.335 line:93%
so I could save this boy.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.514 line:93%
I prayed...

01:04:43.344 --> 01:04:44.384 line:93%
and prayed...

01:04:45.844 --> 01:04:47.344 line:93%
until you woke up.

01:04:49.614 --> 01:04:50.985 line:93%
On the way back...

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:54.255 line:93%
after failing to see you again,

01:04:57.464 --> 01:04:59.795 line:93%
I sincerely hoped...

01:05:02.435 --> 01:05:04.404 line:93%
that you would be alive somewhere.

01:05:11.105 --> 01:05:12.205 line:93%
I prayed...

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.244 line:93%
to see you again.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:24.424 line:93%
You think I'd regret having saved you?

01:05:29.924 --> 01:05:30.924 line:93%
No.

01:05:34.165 --> 01:05:35.594 line:93%
I rather wish...

01:05:35.594 --> 01:05:38.005 line:93%
you haven't saved me when the car was turned over.

01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:43.074 line:93%
I must've died back then.

01:05:48.415 --> 01:05:49.475 line:93%
Then...

01:05:53.214 --> 01:05:56.485 line:93%
I could've died without knowing the ugly truth.

01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:06.685 line:93%
