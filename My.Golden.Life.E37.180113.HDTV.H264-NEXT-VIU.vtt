(Viewer discretion is advised.)

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:11.194 line:93%
There's nothing between me and Do Kyung.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.504 line:93%
There has never been, and not even now.

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:16.133 line:93%
And that would never happen...

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:18.234 line:93%
even in the future.

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:21.603 line:93%
There's nothing I want from Do Kyung either.

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:25.074 line:93%
Especially, I'd never want to go back...

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:28.844 line:93%
to the Haesung family.

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:30.754 line:93%
What?

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:34.354 line:93%
I don't want that.

00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:37.954 line:93%
You "don't want" that?

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:42.693 line:93%
I think I don't belong there.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.434 line:93%
How dare you.

00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:47.934 line:93%
It's better for me to stay away from your family,

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.833 line:93%
but I'm not that shameless...

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:54.004 line:93%
to hurt your family again.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:58.674 line:93%
Then tell me where Do Kyung is. Where is he?

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:01.083 line:93%
I'm sorry,

00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:04.713 line:93%
but I have no right to tell you that.

00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:07.624 line:93%
Since I told you nothing is between him and me,

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.993 line:93%
it would be fair for me to tell you my thoughts only.

00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:13.663 line:93%
Do you want me to believe...

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:16.963 line:93%
that Do Kyung likes you even though you don't?

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.933 line:93%
Why did you rush here when you heard I was here then?

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:22.704 line:93%
I work around this area.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.404 line:93%
From what I heard, I thought it would be you.

00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:28.943 line:93%
My curiosity got better of me.

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:29.943 line:93%
Of course,

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:32.614 line:93%
I wouldn't have come if I knew you were still here.

00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:36.514 line:93%
I didn't want to have an uncomfortable meeting.

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:40.154 line:93%
You were planning to hide behind Do Kyung.

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:42.954 line:93%
That's not true.

00:01:43.693 --> 00:01:45.794 line:93%
I already told you there's nothing between us.

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:49.523 line:93%
You know he left home because of you,

00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:51.734 line:93%
so you probably know his number. However,

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:53.963 line:93%
you can't tell me where he is.

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:55.963 line:93%
Despite all this, there's nothing between you two?

00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:00.704 line:93%
You don't want anything related to Haesung.

00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:03.014 line:93%
You don't like my family.

00:02:03.713 --> 00:02:05.273 line:93%
- Is that what you mean? - Yes.

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:10.384 line:93%
There's nothing I can do about your disbelief.

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:13.724 line:93%
But since I told you the truth about my feelings,

00:02:14.924 --> 00:02:16.753 line:93%
I'd like to ask you not to visit my parents...

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:21.724 line:93%
regarding matters with Mr. Choi Do Kyung.

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.993 line:93%
- Please don't. - Then send Do Kyung back.

00:02:27.164 --> 00:02:28.833 line:93%
If what you are telling me is the truth,

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:31.974 line:93%
send him back home now. Then I'll believe you.

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:35.273 line:93%
I believe that's out of my hands.

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:39.313 line:93%
It's his life. He will make his own decisions.

00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:43.213 line:93%
I don't want to cross paths with you...

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.924 line:93%
for any matters regarding him.

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:50.093 line:93%
You...

00:02:51.123 --> 00:02:52.924 line:93%
You are quite daring.

00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.093 line:93%
I apologize.

00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:57.764 line:93%
You didn't even ask how I knew he liked you.

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:04.134 line:93%
I'm aware that you always get your answers.

00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:09.713 line:93%
Exactly. That's the power I have. Don't forget that.

00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:12.373 line:93%
I won't.

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:15.514 line:93%
Tell Do Kyung to come see me.

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:20.053 line:93%
If I run into him, I will relay the message.

00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:25.523 line:93%
Since I don't know what is going on inside your head,

00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:28.794 line:93%
your claim of indifference means nothing.

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:32.794 line:93%
Don't you...

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.164 line:93%
dare dream about having Do Kyung, Ji An.

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:38.803 line:93%
I won't.

00:03:45.674 --> 00:03:47.313 line:93%
If you finished what you meant to say to me,

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:49.653 line:93%
may I leave now?

00:04:28.183 --> 00:04:30.053 line:93%
How could she be so bold?

00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:48.503 line:93%
Are you all right, Ji An?

00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:51.643 line:93%
You look pale.

00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:56.284 line:93%
What happened? You said she left.

00:04:57.914 --> 00:04:59.654 line:93%
I thought she did.

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:01.854 line:93%
She's no match for anyone.

00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:06.893 line:93%
Ji An, you'll come over now?

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:13.164 line:93%
Ji An. Ji An...

00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:17.073 line:93%
I guess I can wait.

00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:28.683 line:93%
Two cups of Americano.

00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:43.594 line:93%
Don't come now. She came back.

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:49.834 line:93%
(Hee)

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:52.133 line:93%
(Don't come now. She came back.)

00:05:54.174 --> 00:05:56.174 line:93%
I didn't know since my phone was on silent mode.

00:05:57.513 --> 00:06:00.584 line:93%
Do Kyung was the son of the Haesung family?

00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:03.854 line:93%
She was one charismatic woman.

00:06:05.354 --> 00:06:07.253 line:93%
What will you do now, Ji An?

00:06:08.984 --> 00:06:11.193 line:93%
So that's why Hyuk...

00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:13.964 line:93%
was so worried about you.

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:17.594 line:93%
Hee, don't tell Hyuk about this.

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:19.234 line:93%
I'll handle this by myself.

00:06:30.743 --> 00:06:32.873 line:93%
I like the fact that you can manufacture...

00:06:32.873 --> 00:06:34.544 line:93%
both injection and extrusion moldings.

00:06:34.943 --> 00:06:36.683 line:93%
I will contact you after I discuss...

00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:39.154 line:93%
the conditions of the production with the boss.

00:06:39.414 --> 00:06:41.953 line:93%
We're short of work now, so we can take your order.

00:06:42.823 --> 00:06:45.193 line:93%
Thank you. I'll wait for your call.

00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:08.484 line:93%
It was Seo Ji An.

00:07:08.683 --> 00:07:10.654 line:93%
The woman Do Kyung likes is Seo Ji An.

00:07:11.383 --> 00:07:13.024 line:93%
How did you find that out?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.253 line:93%
Thinking back, she was the only one in his life.

00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:21.263 line:93%
Aren't you surprised?

00:07:22.224 --> 00:07:23.993 line:93%
It's a relief if it's Seo Ji An.

00:07:24.164 --> 00:07:25.594 line:93%
"It's a relief"?

00:07:25.993 --> 00:07:29.563 line:93%
Dad might really disown him if it's Seo Ji An.

00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:31.534 line:93%
He will be even more disappointed in us...

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.643 line:93%
for bringing her in and causing him to like her.

00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:36.174 line:93%
That won't happen.

00:07:36.844 --> 00:07:39.174 line:93%
Ji An won't let it get that far.

00:07:39.513 --> 00:07:41.614 line:93%
How do you know that?

00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:44.614 line:93%
She wasn't rude, and she was smart.

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:47.284 line:93%
She knows best how ill-fated...

00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:48.854 line:93%
our families are.

00:07:49.623 --> 00:07:52.854 line:93%
But she wouldn't tell us where he is.

00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:54.763 line:93%
Did you meet with her?

00:07:55.664 --> 00:07:57.364 line:93%
I just met her.

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:00.364 line:93%
I couldn't tell if she was smart...

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:04.073 line:93%
in an innocent way or trying to trick us.

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:08.373 line:93%
I couldn't read her thoughts.

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:10.743 line:93%
We'll find out once he comes back.

00:08:11.443 --> 00:08:14.544 line:93%
She didn't even give me his number.

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:16.614 line:93%
She will tell him about your visit.

00:08:18.953 --> 00:08:20.284 line:93%
She will, won't she?

00:08:21.654 --> 00:08:22.953 line:93%
Even if she doesn't,

00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:26.424 line:93%
you'll make sure Do Kyung comes back home.

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:42.143 line:93%
I don't know what's wrong with me

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:46.444 line:93%
Usually, this has to do with love. Who is she?

00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:48.814 line:93%
- Yong Gook. - Yes?

00:08:49.913 --> 00:08:51.984 line:93%
Ji Soo is acting strange all of a sudden.

00:08:52.954 --> 00:08:54.123 line:93%
But...

00:08:54.653 --> 00:08:55.954 line:93%
I'm acting strange too.

00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:58.824 line:93%
No way. Did you find that out just now?

00:08:58.824 --> 00:09:00.564 line:93%
It's been so long since you started to act weird.

00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:04.094 line:93%
- It's been going on long? - Yes.

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:06.503 line:93%
You are confused, aren't you?

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:10.633 line:93%
"I decided to like Ji An a long time ago,"

00:09:10.773 --> 00:09:13.304 line:93%
"but why do I keep thinking about Ji Soo?"

00:09:14.444 --> 00:09:17.673 line:93%
On Christmas Eve, Ji An was inside,

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:19.684 line:93%
but you kept looking outside.

00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:22.543 line:93%
You were waiting for her, right?

00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:24.954 line:93%
Yes, that. That's it.

00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:29.084 line:93%
When you met Ji An, you said it was fate.

00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:30.423 line:93%
That was a load of nonsense.

00:09:30.523 --> 00:09:31.724 line:93%
"Nonsense"?

00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:35.224 line:93%
Why is that nonsense? She was my first love.

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:37.834 line:93%
Exactly. That. "First love".

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:39.464 line:93%
First love from 10 years ago.

00:09:40.503 --> 00:09:42.763 line:93%
Do you think it's possible...

00:09:42.763 --> 00:09:45.273 line:93%
to like someone after 10 years?

00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:49.743 line:93%
You're caught under the idea of first love.

00:09:50.543 --> 00:09:52.074 line:93%
"The idea of first love"?

00:09:52.214 --> 00:09:54.143 line:93%
You and I are like brothers,

00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:56.614 line:93%
but Do Kyung and I are estranged friends.

00:09:56.984 --> 00:09:59.253 line:93%
If I thought that you really liked her,

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:01.123 line:93%
do you think I'd let him stay at the share house?

00:10:02.523 --> 00:10:04.194 line:93%
He's the enemy of my brother.

00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:06.023 line:93%
Yong Gook.

00:10:06.324 --> 00:10:07.763 line:93%
You thought that far ahead?

00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:11.293 line:93%
Besides, you knew Ji An likes Do Kyung.

00:10:11.493 --> 00:10:13.003 line:93%
But you weren't jealous.

00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:14.464 line:93%
You only worried about her...

00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:16.633 line:93%
like a brother or an uncle.

00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:20.474 line:93%
It's because what she went through is unimaginable.

00:10:21.173 --> 00:10:22.844 line:93%
The girl you keep worrying about,

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:24.513 line:93%
and the girl you can't stop thinking about.

00:10:24.873 --> 00:10:26.074 line:93%
Who do you think you are in love with?

00:10:28.043 --> 00:10:31.013 line:93%
You've been worried about too many people.

00:10:32.954 --> 00:10:34.783 line:93%
Stop pretending to take care of everybody.

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:36.454 line:93%
Even without you,

00:10:37.153 --> 00:10:39.354 line:93%
they find their own ways when the right time comes.

00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:42.094 line:93%
Have I been pretending?

00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:45.263 line:93%
You've been the breadwinner...

00:10:45.263 --> 00:10:46.403 line:93%
since you were young,

00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:48.263 line:93%
and I liked you for your sense of responsibility.

00:10:48.263 --> 00:10:50.373 line:93%
It's my sister. Just a moment.

00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:53.643 line:93%
Yes, Hee.

00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:56.314 line:93%
Hyuk, can you come to the cafe?

00:10:56.543 --> 00:10:59.373 line:93%
Do Kyung's mother came to see Ji An.

00:10:59.373 --> 00:11:00.844 line:93%
Do Kyung's mother?

00:11:02.783 --> 00:11:05.013 line:93%
Did she say how she found out about it?

00:11:05.984 --> 00:11:07.584 line:93%
She didn't say it,

00:11:07.883 --> 00:11:09.653 line:93%
and Ji An didn't ask.

00:11:11.194 --> 00:11:12.393 line:93%
But Hyuk,

00:11:13.094 --> 00:11:14.824 line:93%
Do Kyung's mother...

00:11:15.023 --> 00:11:17.064 line:93%
looked really feisty and scary.

00:11:17.564 --> 00:11:19.704 line:93%
But Ji An was very calm.

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:23.773 line:93%
She knew she'd meet her one day.

00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:27.673 line:93%
The day you brought Ji An to the house,

00:11:28.273 --> 00:11:30.074 line:93%
she was all lethargic.

00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:33.314 line:93%
It had something to do with her, didn't it?

00:11:35.283 --> 00:11:37.054 line:93%
Was she...

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.724 line:93%
in a relationship with Do Kyung?

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.023 line:93%
That's not it.

00:11:42.224 --> 00:11:44.923 line:93%
I can't tell you more about Ji An's business.

00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:46.464 line:93%
Pretend you don't know.

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.364 line:93%
Don't ask Ji An questions.

00:11:48.623 --> 00:11:49.763 line:93%
I won't.

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:51.893 line:93%
The same goes for you too.

00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:55.434 line:93%
Ji An told me not to tell you.

00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:58.574 line:93%
But I thought you should know.

00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:03.273 line:93%
She doesn't want to bother me.

00:12:05.013 --> 00:12:07.684 line:93%
(Waffle Restaurant Franchise Contract)

00:12:10.954 --> 00:12:13.224 line:93%
Now, I am a businessman too.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.554 line:93%
I will make it work out no matter what.

00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:25.464 line:93%
Whatever business you want to run,

00:12:25.864 --> 00:12:27.934 line:93%
you have to work at a similar business...

00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:29.163 line:93%
for at least a year.

00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:33.074 line:93%
Don't think about starting with a franchise.

00:12:35.743 --> 00:12:37.243 line:93%
He's worried for no reason.

00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:43.184 line:93%
Dad, what's wrong?

00:12:44.753 --> 00:12:46.484 line:93%
Why... Why are you vomiting?

00:12:46.554 --> 00:12:47.554 line:93%
It... It's nothing.

00:12:47.554 --> 00:12:50.493 line:93%
I just drank coffee on an empty stomach.

00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:52.993 line:93%
My gosh.

00:12:53.293 --> 00:12:55.793 line:93%
He should've told me that he hadn't eaten.

00:13:16.584 --> 00:13:19.283 line:93%
How much did you practice? You improved so quickly.

00:13:19.513 --> 00:13:22.153 line:93%
I just did it to kill time.

00:13:22.153 --> 00:13:24.694 line:93%
No way. I'm sure you used to play it before.

00:13:26.423 --> 00:13:28.663 line:93%
It was a tree I couldn't climb...

00:13:29.094 --> 00:13:31.263 line:93%
and a dream I couldn't dare to have.

00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:33.864 line:93%
Everyone once had a dream, right?

00:13:34.503 --> 00:13:36.373 line:93%
There are a lot of people like you.

00:13:36.373 --> 00:13:38.273 line:93%
A lot of people learn to play an instrument...

00:13:38.273 --> 00:13:39.704 line:93%
after they retire.

00:13:39.873 --> 00:13:41.704 line:93%
I should introduce you to a hobby group.

00:13:41.704 --> 00:13:43.743 line:93%
That's okay.

00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:46.243 line:93%
Right. You said you were going somewhere.

00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:47.643 line:93%
How long will you be gone for?

00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:49.684 line:93%
You should come back when you're back.

00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:53.623 line:93%
How could he vomit...

00:13:53.623 --> 00:13:56.554 line:93%
after just a sip of coffee on an empty stomach?

00:13:57.393 --> 00:13:59.623 line:93%
I think Dad is not well.

00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:02.464 line:93%
Okay. I will ask him.

00:14:04.533 --> 00:14:06.334 line:93%
I will call you. Okay.

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:12.204 line:93%
(Soo A)

00:14:12.204 --> 00:14:13.543 line:93%
When are you getting off work?

00:14:16.413 --> 00:14:17.714 line:93%
I can get off early.

00:14:34.793 --> 00:14:36.263 line:93%
What's that?

00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:38.993 line:93%
I packed in the morning and left.

00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:41.334 line:93%
We can't keep on fighting...

00:14:41.834 --> 00:14:44.273 line:93%
when your parents are around.

00:14:46.643 --> 00:14:48.574 line:93%
I'll be staying at Seung Hun's place.

00:14:48.903 --> 00:14:49.974 line:93%
What?

00:14:50.513 --> 00:14:51.814 line:93%
Please tell your parents...

00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:54.614 line:93%
that I had to go to a seminar.

00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:58.084 line:93%
Soo A.

00:14:58.084 --> 00:14:59.383 line:93%
If you come with me...

00:15:00.153 --> 00:15:01.954 line:93%
to the hospital on the day of the surgery,

00:15:02.954 --> 00:15:04.694 line:93%
we will be going home together.

00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:06.623 line:93%
But if you don't come,

00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:09.163 line:93%
I will consider the divorce paper signed.

00:15:09.163 --> 00:15:10.864 line:93%
Did you even give it a thought?

00:15:11.094 --> 00:15:13.763 line:93%
Did you hear the baby's heartbeat?

00:15:13.763 --> 00:15:15.564 line:93%
I know that I am committing a sin.

00:15:16.434 --> 00:15:18.434 line:93%
But a child is no toy.

00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:20.704 line:93%
I have to give birth and raise that child.

00:15:20.704 --> 00:15:23.074 line:93%
Nobody has the right to tell me what to do.

00:15:23.474 --> 00:15:26.143 line:93%
Nobody has the right to tell me what to do...

00:15:27.184 --> 00:15:28.383 line:93%
because this is my situation.

00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:31.214 line:93%
So? Are you telling me...

00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:33.554 line:93%
to choose between you and the baby?

00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:38.023 line:93%
Think about why you didn't want to get married...

00:15:38.753 --> 00:15:40.824 line:93%
or have a baby.

00:15:42.194 --> 00:15:43.834 line:93%
Think about it once more.

00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:48.464 line:93%
I will send you the booking confirmation.

00:15:49.834 --> 00:15:50.873 line:93%
Take care.

00:16:39.554 --> 00:16:40.623 line:93%
Ji An.

00:16:42.684 --> 00:16:43.753 line:93%
Aren't you going home?

00:16:43.993 --> 00:16:45.653 line:93%
We have to switch rooms today.

00:16:46.194 --> 00:16:48.163 line:93%
You should go first. I have more things to do.

00:16:48.523 --> 00:16:51.163 line:93%
I packed all my things and put it in Hee's room.

00:16:51.334 --> 00:16:52.834 line:93%
You can use your room now.

00:16:53.234 --> 00:16:54.464 line:93%
How was the class?

00:16:56.263 --> 00:16:58.503 line:93%
It was fun. It's fun.

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:01.804 line:93%
Ji An told me not to tell you.

00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:05.014 line:93%
But I thought you should know.

00:17:06.544 --> 00:17:08.114 line:93%
I'll go home then. See you later at home.

00:17:08.114 --> 00:17:09.754 line:93%
- Okay. See you later. - Okay.

00:17:23.994 --> 00:17:25.163 line:93%
Stop.

00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:29.034 line:93%
What are you doing?

00:17:29.334 --> 00:17:31.034 line:93%
Why are you trying to go inside that room?

00:17:31.804 --> 00:17:33.873 line:93%
Ji An moved to your sister's room.

00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:36.104 line:93%
So I am going to use the room Ji An used.

00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:44.683 line:93%
What are you doing right now?

00:17:45.153 --> 00:17:47.284 line:93%
You can just use this room.

00:17:47.623 --> 00:17:50.294 line:93%
The room Ji An was using is originally my room.

00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:53.463 line:93%
This is a share house. You can't own a room.

00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:54.564 line:93%
But I can.

00:17:54.564 --> 00:17:55.994 line:93%
You get to choose a room by the entry order.

00:17:56.163 --> 00:17:59.233 line:93%
But can't we change rooms if it's necessary?

00:17:59.233 --> 00:18:01.504 line:93%
Do you hate the fact that I will be using...

00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:02.703 line:93%
the room Ji An used?

00:18:02.703 --> 00:18:05.074 line:93%
That's one reason. But...

00:18:05.873 --> 00:18:08.673 line:93%
I just want to use Ji An's room.

00:18:09.443 --> 00:18:11.143 line:93%
You're not even sure about how long you'll stay here.

00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:15.943 line:93%
Do Kyung.

00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:18.713 line:93%
It's not the time to fuss over this.

00:18:19.413 --> 00:18:21.883 line:93%
Your mother visited Ji An.

00:18:22.383 --> 00:18:23.393 line:93%
What?

00:18:39.534 --> 00:18:40.604 line:93%
Hey.

00:18:41.104 --> 00:18:42.673 line:93%
What a coincidence.

00:18:43.614 --> 00:18:45.913 line:93%
I was hungry, so I came out to buy some snacks.

00:18:46.544 --> 00:18:47.584 line:93%
I see.

00:18:48.913 --> 00:18:51.284 line:93%
By the way, you come home way too late.

00:18:51.284 --> 00:18:52.554 line:93%
It's dangerous at night.

00:18:54.854 --> 00:18:55.983 line:93%
You're eating a steamed bun.

00:18:56.854 --> 00:18:58.324 line:93%
You eat this too now?

00:19:00.794 --> 00:19:03.034 line:93%
Here. It's a vegetable bun.

00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:05.994 line:93%
Thank you.

00:19:08.733 --> 00:19:09.774 line:93%
And...

00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:12.203 line:93%
here. Take this too.

00:19:14.304 --> 00:19:16.173 line:93%
I used it well. Thank you.

00:19:18.274 --> 00:19:19.913 line:93%
If Mother met you already,

00:19:20.643 --> 00:19:22.983 line:93%
there's no point in hiding where I am.

00:19:25.383 --> 00:19:26.923 line:93%
Why didn't you call me right away?

00:19:28.453 --> 00:19:30.554 line:93%
You said you were meeting a lot of investors today.

00:19:32.223 --> 00:19:33.623 line:93%
So you waited because you didn't want to...

00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:35.393 line:93%
interrupt my work.

00:19:36.864 --> 00:19:39.264 line:93%
It wasn't an urgent matter anyway.

00:19:40.663 --> 00:19:42.973 line:93%
She said you should come and meet her.

00:19:44.973 --> 00:19:46.074 line:93%
How...

00:19:46.703 --> 00:19:48.673 line:93%
did Mother find out?

00:19:50.244 --> 00:19:52.643 line:93%
She didn't ask me, and I didn't ask her.

00:19:55.483 --> 00:19:56.814 line:93%
Didn't you get curious?

00:19:58.983 --> 00:20:00.054 line:93%
I didn't.

00:20:01.423 --> 00:20:03.123 line:93%
What did you talk about?

00:20:05.094 --> 00:20:06.794 line:93%
You should hear it from her.

00:20:07.064 --> 00:20:09.364 line:93%
I told her everything about where I stand...

00:20:09.794 --> 00:20:11.094 line:93%
and what I think.

00:20:12.064 --> 00:20:13.233 line:93%
Don't worry.

00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:15.903 line:93%
It happened earlier than I expected.

00:20:16.604 --> 00:20:18.133 line:93%
But I will take care of it.

00:20:19.804 --> 00:20:21.703 line:93%
I couldn't hide it for a long time anyway.

00:20:22.443 --> 00:20:23.943 line:93%
And I didn't want to hide it either.

00:20:25.744 --> 00:20:27.614 line:93%
I almost finished finding the OEM factory,

00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:29.784 line:93%
and I reduced the budget significantly.

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:31.913 line:93%
They said they would invest...

00:20:31.913 --> 00:20:33.153 line:93%
if I reduce the budget.

00:20:35.483 --> 00:20:36.693 line:93%
I will get the investment soon...

00:20:37.294 --> 00:20:38.653 line:93%
and stand on my own feet.

00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:40.923 line:93%
Trust me.

00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:46.233 line:93%
This is good.

00:21:00.413 --> 00:21:01.443 line:93%
Goodnight.

00:21:18.334 --> 00:21:19.703 line:93%
I can do it.

00:21:20.703 --> 00:21:22.463 line:93%
I can do it. I can do it.

00:21:23.703 --> 00:21:25.133 line:93%
Are you joining a competition?

00:21:25.133 --> 00:21:26.133 line:93%
No.

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.574 line:93%
I was just making a resolution.

00:21:32.643 --> 00:21:35.014 line:93%
You got dumped, haven't you?

00:21:35.314 --> 00:21:36.413 line:93%
What... What?

00:21:36.413 --> 00:21:38.713 line:93%
What are you saying?

00:21:39.554 --> 00:21:41.383 line:93%
I heard you cry a few days ago,

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:42.584 line:93%
your eyes were all swollen,

00:21:42.584 --> 00:21:44.324 line:93%
and you were always zoned out.

00:21:46.564 --> 00:21:48.693 line:93%
I've experienced that too.

00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:51.594 line:93%
Was it that obvious?

00:21:52.494 --> 00:21:55.864 line:93%
Are you telling yourself that you can forget him?

00:21:56.903 --> 00:21:58.004 line:93%
Yes.

00:21:58.604 --> 00:22:01.104 line:93%
I am practicing to forget him in a cool way.

00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:03.943 line:93%
I am going to wish for his happiness.

00:22:05.014 --> 00:22:07.614 line:93%
You're going to wish for his happiness too?

00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:10.413 line:93%
"I don't like you at all."

00:22:11.483 --> 00:22:14.824 line:93%
"I am not interested in you at all."

00:22:16.324 --> 00:22:18.854 line:93%
"So I hope you end up to be with the person..."

00:22:20.193 --> 00:22:21.524 line:93%
"you've been liking for so long."

00:22:32.703 --> 00:22:34.274 line:93%
Why did you get up so early?

00:22:35.943 --> 00:22:37.643 line:93%
I was going to wake you up after I finished this.

00:22:38.673 --> 00:22:41.443 line:93%
You surprised me. I thought you were gone.

00:22:42.614 --> 00:22:44.014 line:93%
I am not going anywhere.

00:22:44.514 --> 00:22:47.254 line:93%
I will always be where you can see me.

00:22:47.524 --> 00:22:48.554 line:93%
Okay?

00:22:51.254 --> 00:22:54.123 line:93%
What are you cooking? I told you not to do this.

00:22:54.223 --> 00:22:56.024 line:93%
I can't sleep in.

00:22:56.693 --> 00:23:00.334 line:93%
Today's breakfast is beef radish soup.

00:23:01.804 --> 00:23:03.334 line:93%
I am going to cook tomorrow's breakfast.

00:23:03.334 --> 00:23:05.004 line:93%
- Don't get up before me. - Hey, that tickles.

00:23:05.004 --> 00:23:06.443 line:93%
Stop it. Seriously.

00:23:06.574 --> 00:23:09.604 line:93%
Stop it. It tickles. It really tickles.

00:23:13.713 --> 00:23:14.713 line:93%
Let's eat.

00:23:20.683 --> 00:23:21.854 line:93%
Hello.

00:23:21.854 --> 00:23:23.094 line:93%
You're here early today.

00:23:23.623 --> 00:23:25.354 line:93%
You're a good assistant.

00:23:25.354 --> 00:23:28.423 line:93%
I'm glad you're here. I will drop her off.

00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:30.064 line:93%
Please pack the breads when they're done.

00:23:30.594 --> 00:23:32.494 line:93%
I will make you a cup of coffee in return.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.834 line:93%
Don't worry and enjoy your morning date.

00:23:34.834 --> 00:23:36.834 line:93%
- Thank you. - Let's go.

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:38.104 line:93%
You should put on your winter jacket.

00:23:38.104 --> 00:23:39.104 line:93%
Oh, my winter jacket.

00:23:40.443 --> 00:23:41.774 line:93%
Okay. Let's hurry.

00:23:45.643 --> 00:23:46.913 line:93%
I envy them.

00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:49.814 line:93%
We're not open...

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.324 line:93%
Nam Goo isn't here.

00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:59.193 line:93%
He went to drop Hee off at her cafe.

00:23:59.893 --> 00:24:01.494 line:93%
Then we can talk here.

00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:04.233 line:93%
I just couldn't understand.

00:24:05.193 --> 00:24:07.133 line:93%
Why are you suddenly doing this to me, Ji Soo?

00:24:08.463 --> 00:24:09.633 line:93%
What did I do?

00:24:09.774 --> 00:24:12.604 line:93%
You said you didn't like me. Why did you say that?

00:24:12.873 --> 00:24:15.104 line:93%
I've always been the same.

00:24:17.344 --> 00:24:19.373 line:93%
Did I do something wrong to you?

00:24:23.284 --> 00:24:26.354 line:93%
I didn't know you were this slow.

00:24:27.054 --> 00:24:28.084 line:93%
What?

00:24:28.254 --> 00:24:30.854 line:93%
I told you that there's no reason for it.

00:24:38.233 --> 00:24:39.233 line:93%
No.

00:24:40.334 --> 00:24:41.633 line:93%
There is a reason.

00:24:42.463 --> 00:24:45.274 line:93%
People's feelings don't change overnight.

00:24:48.104 --> 00:24:49.673 line:93%
It's just because I got a boyfriend.

00:24:52.473 --> 00:24:54.084 line:93%
It's not that I don't like you.

00:24:54.443 --> 00:24:56.784 line:93%
I'm just not attracted to you.

00:24:56.883 --> 00:25:00.683 line:93%
I think you are a good person.

00:25:02.623 --> 00:25:04.153 line:93%
You got a boyfriend?

00:25:04.354 --> 00:25:05.393 line:93%
Yes.

00:25:06.094 --> 00:25:08.494 line:93%
He's been chasing after me for a while.

00:25:13.004 --> 00:25:14.433 line:93%
By the way, Mr. Sunwoo,

00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:17.304 line:93%
is it wrong for a girl like me to not like you?

00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:23.514 line:93%
I have to bring out the bread. Bye.

00:25:41.923 --> 00:25:43.294 line:93%
Aren't you going to the office today?

00:25:46.403 --> 00:25:48.104 line:93%
I think Do Kyung will show up.

00:25:49.973 --> 00:25:51.504 line:93%
He won't be able to come to the office,

00:25:51.504 --> 00:25:53.004 line:93%
so I thought he would come home.

00:25:57.114 --> 00:25:58.173 line:93%
He is...

00:25:58.173 --> 00:25:59.173 line:93%
(Choi Do Kyung)

00:25:59.173 --> 00:26:00.683 line:93%
using his phone again.

00:26:01.443 --> 00:26:02.443 line:93%
How about you?

00:26:03.054 --> 00:26:04.054 line:93%
I have a meeting.

00:26:22.633 --> 00:26:23.834 line:93%
I'm here.

00:26:26.473 --> 00:26:28.403 line:93%
She said she wasn't interested in you at all.

00:26:28.774 --> 00:26:30.173 line:93%
But she called you right away, didn't she?

00:26:34.913 --> 00:26:36.713 line:93%
Ji An didn't tell me.

00:26:37.854 --> 00:26:39.554 line:93%
I heard it through someone at the cafe.

00:26:40.354 --> 00:26:42.153 line:93%
I heard you met Ji An.

00:26:42.754 --> 00:26:44.294 line:93%
It's the same thing.

00:26:44.294 --> 00:26:46.623 line:93%
They're all related to Ji An anyway.

00:26:47.794 --> 00:26:48.864 line:93%
By the way,

00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:51.294 line:93%
how did you find out about it?

00:26:52.794 --> 00:26:54.203 line:93%
Ji An said this.

00:26:55.163 --> 00:26:57.473 line:93%
She said that she knew I could find out...

00:26:57.473 --> 00:26:58.774 line:93%
about anything I want to know.

00:27:00.104 --> 00:27:01.504 line:93%
Didn't you know?

00:27:01.943 --> 00:27:04.873 line:93%
Did you not know what Ji An knows?

00:27:06.344 --> 00:27:08.383 line:93%
You must've been very surprised.

00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:12.054 line:93%
I can't believe it.

00:27:13.784 --> 00:27:15.623 line:93%
Ji An won't even accept me,

00:27:16.554 --> 00:27:18.653 line:93%
but still, I left home. It must be surprising.

00:27:19.663 --> 00:27:20.723 line:93%
If you think...

00:27:21.163 --> 00:27:22.794 line:93%
I did it only for Ji An.

00:27:22.794 --> 00:27:24.663 line:93%
Are you talking about your grand plan...

00:27:24.663 --> 00:27:25.834 line:93%
of standing on your own feet...

00:27:25.834 --> 00:27:27.104 line:93%
and starting your own business?

00:27:27.663 --> 00:27:29.774 line:93%
Are you talking about affording to live...

00:27:29.873 --> 00:27:32.534 line:93%
the way you want and find ways to be happy?

00:27:33.504 --> 00:27:34.643 line:93%
Yes.

00:27:34.673 --> 00:27:36.274 line:93%
Would you do that even without Ji An?

00:27:39.413 --> 00:27:41.514 line:93%
Would you have moved out if it weren't for Ji An?

00:27:42.014 --> 00:27:44.713 line:93%
Would you have looked for ways...

00:27:44.814 --> 00:27:46.723 line:93%
to be happy if it weren't for Ji An?

00:27:47.723 --> 00:27:48.953 line:93%
I wouldn't have.

00:27:50.054 --> 00:27:52.153 line:93%
I wanted to be with Ji An while doing so.

00:27:54.163 --> 00:27:55.693 line:93%
In the end, you did it for a woman.

00:27:55.693 --> 00:27:57.494 line:93%
Don't try covering it up.

00:27:58.393 --> 00:27:59.463 line:93%
Do I look funny to you?

00:27:59.864 --> 00:28:02.403 line:93%
Do you think I'd joke around with you?

00:28:02.933 --> 00:28:05.873 line:93%
Mother, you used to approve and like Ji An.

00:28:05.933 --> 00:28:08.104 line:93%
That's when I thought she was my daughter.

00:28:08.703 --> 00:28:10.443 line:93%
I liked her when she was my daughter.

00:28:11.143 --> 00:28:12.574 line:93%
But whose daughter is she?

00:28:12.744 --> 00:28:14.844 line:93%
She's Seo Tae Soo and Yang Mi Jung's daughter.

00:28:14.844 --> 00:28:17.514 line:93%
But that's not Ji An's fault.

00:28:17.983 --> 00:28:19.054 line:93%
What?

00:28:19.514 --> 00:28:21.483 line:93%
Please only consider Ji An herself.

00:28:22.354 --> 00:28:24.094 line:93%
"Ji An herself"?

00:28:25.693 --> 00:28:26.893 line:93%
Why would I?

00:28:27.094 --> 00:28:29.564 line:93%
She doesn't even deserve to be mentioned.

00:28:30.193 --> 00:28:31.264 line:93%
She's become...

00:28:32.064 --> 00:28:34.403 line:93%
very precious to me.

00:28:36.034 --> 00:28:37.074 line:93%
So?

00:28:38.004 --> 00:28:40.873 line:93%
Did you win her over? Are you in a relationship?

00:28:45.173 --> 00:28:47.114 line:93%
Was she telling the truth?

00:28:48.383 --> 00:28:49.383 line:93%
What...

00:28:50.284 --> 00:28:51.713 line:93%
did Ji An say?

00:28:51.713 --> 00:28:54.284 line:93%
"I don't understand either why Do Kyung left home..."

00:28:54.284 --> 00:28:55.883 line:93%
"even though there's nothing."

00:28:55.953 --> 00:28:59.354 line:93%
"So stop yell at me and settle it with your son."

00:29:02.193 --> 00:29:04.193 line:93%
"I never thought of and never will think"

00:29:04.193 --> 00:29:06.433 line:93%
"about getting involved with him."

00:29:07.703 --> 00:29:11.304 line:93%
"There's nothing I want to gain through him."

00:29:11.304 --> 00:29:13.344 line:93%
"I especially have no intention..."

00:29:13.344 --> 00:29:16.274 line:93%
"of joining your family ever again."

00:29:21.213 --> 00:29:24.054 line:93%
She's the one who disapproves our family.

00:29:28.754 --> 00:29:30.794 line:93%
She's so daring and rude.

00:29:31.354 --> 00:29:34.494 line:93%
She spoke clearly without getting intimidated.

00:29:36.064 --> 00:29:37.163 line:93%
If that was a show,

00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:39.703 line:93%
you two must've planned this together.

00:29:39.703 --> 00:29:41.933 line:93%
We didn't do that. Never.

00:29:42.163 --> 00:29:44.004 line:93%
You "never" planned that with her?

00:29:44.373 --> 00:29:45.774 line:93%
Does that mean you ran away from home...

00:29:45.774 --> 00:29:47.274 line:93%
just because of your one-sided love?

00:29:47.274 --> 00:29:48.844 line:93%
You, the successor of Haesung Corporation?

00:29:49.203 --> 00:29:52.014 line:93%
Have you lost your mind? How does this make sense?

00:29:53.044 --> 00:29:54.883 line:93%
Are you really my son, Do Kyung?

00:29:55.014 --> 00:29:58.114 line:93%
I haven't changed my mind about living my life...

00:29:58.114 --> 00:29:59.153 line:93%
the way I want.

00:30:00.453 --> 00:30:01.483 line:93%
I couldn't tell you...

00:30:01.483 --> 00:30:02.754 line:93%
because Ji An didn't approve it.

00:30:04.324 --> 00:30:05.623 line:93%
But even if I had told you,

00:30:05.923 --> 00:30:07.463 line:93%
you wouldn't have approved my plan.

00:30:07.963 --> 00:30:09.864 line:93%
So I came up with my own way.

00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:12.764 line:93%
But you found out about it first.

00:30:14.163 --> 00:30:15.933 line:93%
Now that I know it, you should come back...

00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:17.203 line:93%
before your grandfather finds out about it.

00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:19.304 line:93%
Now that I know,

00:30:19.703 --> 00:30:21.173 line:93%
I won't leave you alone.

00:30:21.173 --> 00:30:23.143 line:93%
Now that you know I like her alone,

00:30:23.973 --> 00:30:26.074 line:93%
you don't have to see Ji An again.

00:30:27.084 --> 00:30:29.913 line:93%
I left home without money as Grandfather wanted,

00:30:31.584 --> 00:30:32.653 line:93%
so you don't...

00:30:33.223 --> 00:30:35.324 line:93%
have the right to force me to come back home either.

00:30:36.494 --> 00:30:37.494 line:93%
What?

00:30:38.524 --> 00:30:40.163 line:93%
I should get going then.

00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:46.334 line:93%
I'll see you later. Please take care.

00:30:56.358 --> 00:31:01.358 line:93%

did she know?

00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:36.983 line:93%
She didn't tell me and I didn't ask her.

00:31:38.213 --> 00:31:39.754 line:93%
What did she say?

00:31:40.683 --> 00:31:42.254 line:93%
You should hear it from her.

00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:45.094 line:93%
I told her everything about where I stand...

00:31:45.453 --> 00:31:46.864 line:93%
and what I think.

I'm coming back after seeing my mother.

00:32:18.153 --> 00:32:19.254 line:93%
I see.

00:32:21.564 --> 00:32:22.794 line:93%
What...

00:32:23.633 --> 00:32:25.233 line:93%
did you tell her?

00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:28.963 line:93%
I don't think...

00:32:28.963 --> 00:32:31.433 line:93%
she would've told you what I didn't say.

00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:33.544 line:93%
She knew you'd ask me that like this.

00:32:34.574 --> 00:32:37.614 line:93%
Then did you really say all that?

00:32:39.344 --> 00:32:40.943 line:93%
There's nothing between you and me.

00:32:41.683 --> 00:32:43.213 line:93%
And nothing will happen even in the future.

00:32:44.614 --> 00:32:46.114 line:93%
Did you really have to say that?

00:32:48.524 --> 00:32:50.153 line:93%
It's just how I feel.

00:32:50.693 --> 00:32:52.054 line:93%
I told you before.

00:32:53.463 --> 00:32:54.963 line:93%
It's not that I'm afraid.

00:32:55.963 --> 00:32:57.133 line:93%
I don't like it.

00:32:57.693 --> 00:32:59.334 line:93%
You live in a completely different world...

00:32:59.334 --> 00:33:00.703 line:93%
where I don't belong.

00:33:01.233 --> 00:33:02.334 line:93%
So...

00:33:04.203 --> 00:33:06.473 line:93%
I don't want to go back there ever again.

00:33:06.673 --> 00:33:08.143 line:93%
This is my decision.

00:33:08.744 --> 00:33:10.614 line:93%
My decision for my own life.

00:33:11.044 --> 00:33:12.344 line:93%
There's...

00:33:13.014 --> 00:33:15.244 line:93%
another world that I can't see.

00:33:16.183 --> 00:33:17.483 line:93%
It is...

00:33:18.354 --> 00:33:20.254 line:93%
different from my world.

00:33:20.423 --> 00:33:21.453 line:93%
I can't...

00:33:22.554 --> 00:33:24.594 line:93%
be happy in that world.

00:33:27.594 --> 00:33:28.923 line:93%
Couldn't you trust me...

00:33:28.923 --> 00:33:30.764 line:93%
and pluck up your courage?

00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:33.304 line:93%
You could've avoided it...

00:33:33.304 --> 00:33:34.334 line:93%
by telling her...

00:33:34.663 --> 00:33:36.334 line:93%
to ask me about everything.

00:33:38.004 --> 00:33:39.643 line:93%
To ask you about it?

00:33:40.873 --> 00:33:42.304 line:93%
What's that supposed to mean?

00:33:43.014 --> 00:33:45.143 line:93%
That means I will accept you.

00:33:46.114 --> 00:33:47.713 line:93%
I'm trying hard here.

00:33:48.143 --> 00:33:49.443 line:93%
I'm trying real hard.

00:33:49.754 --> 00:33:50.953 line:93%
I left home,

00:33:50.953 --> 00:33:52.314 line:93%
and I'm trying to stand on my own feet.

00:33:52.314 --> 00:33:54.584 line:93%
I'm doing all this because of you.

00:33:54.653 --> 00:33:56.854 line:93%
Can't you see that? You know it.

00:33:57.123 --> 00:33:58.354 line:93%
You know everything.

00:33:58.354 --> 00:34:00.064 line:93%
I know. I really do.

00:34:01.824 --> 00:34:03.233 line:93%
But I just can't understand this.

00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:06.463 line:93%
If your heart is in the right place...

00:34:07.104 --> 00:34:09.503 line:93%
and you're trying hard because of me,

00:34:10.434 --> 00:34:13.144 line:93%
do I have to follow your wish? Why?

00:34:13.144 --> 00:34:14.704 line:93%
Because you like me too.

00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:17.273 line:93%
Because we're in the same place.

00:34:18.574 --> 00:34:21.383 line:93%
I like you, but I won't do anything with you.

00:34:21.614 --> 00:34:24.483 line:93%
I'm right here. Why can't you do that?

00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:27.253 line:93%
I'm right here to protect you.

00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:29.693 line:93%
I'm working hard to stand on my own feet...

00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:31.894 line:93%
to be independent of my parents and grandfather.

00:34:32.923 --> 00:34:34.764 line:93%
What do you want to do with me?

00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:38.293 line:93%
Do you want to marry me?

00:34:38.894 --> 00:34:39.934 line:93%
Yes.

00:34:41.264 --> 00:34:42.563 line:93%
That's ridiculous.

00:34:44.103 --> 00:34:45.133 line:93%
What?

00:34:45.434 --> 00:34:46.974 line:93%
I said that's not what I want.

00:34:48.374 --> 00:34:50.313 line:93%
I've been part of your family before.

00:34:50.673 --> 00:34:52.943 line:93%
So I know the rules of your family.

00:34:53.744 --> 00:34:55.943 line:93%
I know what they'd ask me for...

00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:59.184 line:93%
and that I will have to obey those rules.

00:35:00.224 --> 00:35:01.583 line:93%
That's not what I want.

00:35:01.653 --> 00:35:03.124 line:93%
Why do you hate it so much?

00:35:03.724 --> 00:35:05.853 line:93%
Because I'll have to live as someone who's not me.

00:35:06.894 --> 00:35:07.963 line:93%
You told me that you don't...

00:35:07.963 --> 00:35:09.793 line:93%
want to live as a part of the Haesung family.

00:35:10.063 --> 00:35:11.693 line:93%
That's why you moved out to be independent

00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:13.133 line:93%
I meant I'd be like that...

00:35:13.133 --> 00:35:14.534 line:93%
if I went back without you.

00:35:15.304 --> 00:35:16.534 line:93%
Things have changed now.

00:35:17.074 --> 00:35:19.844 line:93%
Ji An, just take my hand.

00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:21.344 line:93%
Please trust me.

00:35:21.344 --> 00:35:23.443 line:93%
Why do I have to trust you?

00:35:24.514 --> 00:35:26.244 line:93%
Do I have to take your hand...

00:35:26.244 --> 00:35:27.983 line:93%
whenever you reach out?

00:35:27.983 --> 00:35:29.483 line:93%
Why? Because you're rich?

00:35:30.483 --> 00:35:32.014 line:93%
I don't need it.

00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:33.784 line:93%
I don't like it because you're rich.

00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:36.653 line:93%
I...

00:35:38.324 --> 00:35:40.124 line:93%
just started to be happy only now.

00:35:41.063 --> 00:35:43.563 line:93%
I just started to learn what it is like...

00:35:44.293 --> 00:35:46.603 line:93%
to live at ease. Here. Now.

00:35:46.664 --> 00:35:48.833 line:93%
Is your happiness cutting wood at a carpenter's?

00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:50.304 line:93%
How would it make you happy?

00:35:51.534 --> 00:35:52.704 line:93%
What did you say?

00:35:52.704 --> 00:35:54.903 line:93%
You worked desperately to become a regular employee.

00:35:55.244 --> 00:35:56.974 line:93%
I'm telling you that I will end that for you.

00:35:59.614 --> 00:36:01.414 line:93%
Why are you upset with me?

00:36:01.713 --> 00:36:03.253 line:93%
You don't have the right to be upset.

00:36:05.483 --> 00:36:07.054 line:93%
Why would you think the poor...

00:36:07.054 --> 00:36:08.954 line:93%
always have to listen to the rich?

00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:14.063 line:93%
Do I not have the right to reject Haesung?

00:36:15.264 --> 00:36:17.394 line:93%
Is it wrong to not like you because...

00:36:18.133 --> 00:36:19.534 line:93%
you're the successor of Haesung?

00:36:22.733 --> 00:36:23.874 line:93%
I did work hard...

00:36:23.874 --> 00:36:26.003 line:93%
just to be a regular employee...

00:36:26.574 --> 00:36:27.844 line:93%
in the past.

00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:29.813 line:93%
But not anymore.

00:36:33.043 --> 00:36:34.213 line:93%
I...

00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.383 line:93%
have been through life and death.

00:36:38.313 --> 00:36:40.684 line:93%
So I know it now. I know it.

00:36:42.523 --> 00:36:44.153 line:93%
Where I belong,

00:36:44.353 --> 00:36:46.054 line:93%
who I am,

00:36:46.693 --> 00:36:48.824 line:93%
and where I can be happy.

00:36:52.394 --> 00:36:53.463 line:93%
You...

00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:57.173 line:93%
You're serious.

00:36:58.003 --> 00:36:59.273 line:93%
Yes.

00:37:00.304 --> 00:37:01.403 line:93%
I am.

00:37:04.443 --> 00:37:07.284 line:93%
So please stop it, and go back.

00:37:08.844 --> 00:37:10.253 line:93%
I keep feeling sorry,

00:37:11.153 --> 00:37:12.883 line:93%
and it's hard to watch you struggle.

00:37:19.664 --> 00:37:21.364 line:93%
I should get back to work.

00:38:34.204 --> 00:38:36.503 line:93%
My name is Seo Tae Soo.

00:38:36.934 --> 00:38:38.574 line:93%
I hope it won't happen,

00:38:38.574 --> 00:38:41.043 line:93%
but if you find me collapsed on the floor,

00:38:41.144 --> 00:38:43.144 line:93%
please call Hyangrim Hospital...

00:38:43.273 --> 00:38:46.443 line:93%
or Ms. Yang Mi Jung.

00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:50.983 line:93%
It's done now.

00:38:55.224 --> 00:38:56.423 line:93%
Have a good day.

00:39:01.193 --> 00:39:03.164 line:93%
(Overseas call)

00:39:06.963 --> 00:39:08.003 line:93%
Hello?

00:39:08.034 --> 00:39:10.534 line:93%
Ji Tae? This is Seok Doo.

00:39:10.804 --> 00:39:13.043 line:93%
Hello, what's the matter?

00:39:16.003 --> 00:39:17.943 line:93%
Dad is being odd?

00:39:18.043 --> 00:39:20.014 line:93%
He has a stomachache and throws up often.

00:39:20.313 --> 00:39:23.284 line:93%
He shows symptoms of stomach cancer.

00:39:23.353 --> 00:39:25.353 line:93%
You should take him to the hospital.

00:39:25.383 --> 00:39:26.883 line:93%
This doesn't feel good.

00:39:26.883 --> 00:39:28.684 line:93%
Okay. I will.

00:39:30.494 --> 00:39:32.753 line:93%
Thank you. Bye.

00:39:49.543 --> 00:39:50.644 line:93%
Tae Soo.

00:39:56.883 --> 00:39:59.554 line:93%
Tae Soo, what's wrong?

00:40:00.083 --> 00:40:01.883 line:93%
You're breaking out in a cold sweat.

00:40:02.454 --> 00:40:04.153 line:93%
What's the matter?

00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:06.563 line:93%
I'm okay.

00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:08.364 line:93%
You're not okay.

00:40:08.693 --> 00:40:11.333 line:93%
I should call 911 and take you to the emergency room.

00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:14.304 line:93%
No, you don't have to do that. My goodness.

00:40:14.333 --> 00:40:15.364 line:93%
Never mind.

00:40:21.244 --> 00:40:24.414 line:93%
Since it's for a family, I'll serve this one.

00:40:24.414 --> 00:40:25.414 line:93%
Okay.

00:40:29.914 --> 00:40:31.353 line:93%
Here's your order.

00:40:31.353 --> 00:40:33.724 line:93%
- It's our new menu. - It looks good.

00:40:37.324 --> 00:40:38.693 line:93%
How do you like it?

00:40:38.954 --> 00:40:41.664 line:93%
The patty's made with beef only.

00:40:43.094 --> 00:40:44.864 line:93%
It's moist and delicious.

00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:48.063 line:93%
Honey, your parents would like this too.

00:40:48.063 --> 00:40:50.273 line:93%
- Let's bring them here. - Okay.

00:41:09.054 --> 00:41:12.054 line:93%
I didn't believe my husband when he said...

00:41:12.054 --> 00:41:14.624 line:93%
Tae Soo showed symptoms of stomach cancer.

00:41:14.894 --> 00:41:17.463 line:93%
But I found Tae Soo crouched outside the gate.

00:41:18.764 --> 00:41:21.264 line:93%
I don't think it's something to ignore.

00:41:22.864 --> 00:41:24.804 line:93%
He... He's showing Seok Doo's symptoms?

00:41:31.874 --> 00:41:34.043 line:93%
My mom's full of energy.

00:41:35.443 --> 00:41:37.114 line:93%
She's fine without me.

00:41:43.653 --> 00:41:44.853 line:93%
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:41:45.793 --> 00:41:47.193 line:93%
What? Mom...

00:41:55.503 --> 00:41:58.333 line:93%
Why didn't she recognize me?

00:42:08.383 --> 00:42:10.784 line:93%
He's taking guitar lessons and naps.

00:42:11.114 --> 00:42:12.184 line:93%
It can't be.

00:42:18.423 --> 00:42:20.523 line:93%
Did I sleep for that long?

00:42:26.704 --> 00:42:28.333 line:93%
Ji Ho, you too?

00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:30.903 line:93%
Why are you at home?

00:42:31.773 --> 00:42:34.144 line:93%
Because of you. Sit down.

00:42:37.844 --> 00:42:39.144 line:93%
What for?

00:42:39.684 --> 00:42:42.213 line:93%
Seok Doo called me.

00:42:43.014 --> 00:42:44.153 line:93%
Seok Doo called?

00:42:44.653 --> 00:42:45.883 line:93%
What for?

00:42:46.253 --> 00:42:49.793 line:93%
You've been vomiting and having stomach aches.

00:42:49.994 --> 00:42:51.994 line:93%
He thinks they're stomach cancer symptoms,

00:42:51.994 --> 00:42:53.563 line:93%
and he told us that you should see a doctor.

00:42:54.193 --> 00:42:55.864 line:93%
Gosh, he must have lost his mind.

00:42:56.394 --> 00:42:58.733 line:93%
Grandma died of stomach cancer too.

00:42:59.563 --> 00:43:01.003 line:93%
It runs in the family.

00:43:01.463 --> 00:43:02.833 line:93%
It wasn't just a few times.

00:43:02.974 --> 00:43:05.434 line:93%
Ji Ho saw it and Mom noticed.

00:43:05.434 --> 00:43:06.974 line:93%
And earlier, Hae Ja saw it too.

00:43:06.974 --> 00:43:10.173 line:93%
He told you nonsense just to cause us trouble.

00:43:10.874 --> 00:43:13.043 line:93%
It's not that. I'm fine.

00:43:13.514 --> 00:43:15.713 line:93%
Let's go to the ER with us.

00:43:15.883 --> 00:43:18.583 line:93%
I got a physical so I could board the ship.

00:43:18.883 --> 00:43:20.684 line:93%
I just have stomach ulcers.

00:43:21.353 --> 00:43:23.054 line:93%
You got a check-up?

00:43:23.394 --> 00:43:24.653 line:93%
I did.

00:43:26.054 --> 00:43:28.923 line:93%
Then show me the results.

00:43:30.164 --> 00:43:31.193 line:93%
What?

00:43:31.193 --> 00:43:33.204 line:93%
To see if the test was valid.

00:43:33.204 --> 00:43:36.603 line:93%
Why would I show you what I got and checked?

00:43:36.833 --> 00:43:39.974 line:93%
Then show it to me so I can look at it too.

00:43:39.974 --> 00:43:43.144 line:93%
Why do you want to see my physical test results?

00:43:43.144 --> 00:43:44.874 line:93%
Because we're worried.

00:43:45.644 --> 00:43:46.943 line:93%
Why are you worried?

00:43:47.483 --> 00:43:48.914 line:93%
Why do you care?

00:43:49.184 --> 00:43:52.983 line:93%
I said I'm fine. What right do you have to ask?

00:43:53.483 --> 00:43:56.353 line:93%
How could you say we don't have any rights?

00:43:56.353 --> 00:43:58.153 line:93%
We're family.

00:43:58.153 --> 00:43:59.793 line:93%
Why are we family?

00:44:00.164 --> 00:44:03.563 line:93%
I told you before that we'll fend for ourselves.

00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:05.963 line:93%
Stay out of my business.

00:44:08.034 --> 00:44:11.704 line:93%
I won't ask you to pay for my medical bills, so stop.

00:44:11.704 --> 00:44:13.503 line:93%
Don't say that.

00:44:13.644 --> 00:44:15.344 line:93%
This is not about the hospital bills.

00:44:15.474 --> 00:44:16.974 line:93%
Then what's the fuss?

00:44:17.114 --> 00:44:18.313 line:93%
Dad.

00:44:18.713 --> 00:44:20.844 line:93%
If you get so overly sensitive,

00:44:21.684 --> 00:44:23.184 line:93%
it'll be too hard on us.

00:44:23.184 --> 00:44:24.353 line:93%
Dad.

00:44:24.713 --> 00:44:27.753 line:93%
Are you that angry that I considered emigrating...

00:44:27.753 --> 00:44:29.124 line:93%
and moving out?

00:44:30.094 --> 00:44:33.693 line:93%
I was disappointed and angry with you and Mom.

00:44:34.693 --> 00:44:36.023 line:93%
Yes.

00:44:36.764 --> 00:44:40.333 line:93%
Did it never occur to you to ask why we did that...

00:44:40.403 --> 00:44:44.233 line:93%
and what we were thinking?

00:44:47.204 --> 00:44:48.574 line:93%
If I were richer,

00:44:48.574 --> 00:44:51.813 line:93%
not only would you have mentioned emigration,

00:44:52.374 --> 00:44:54.313 line:93%
but you would've discussed with me.

00:44:56.313 --> 00:44:58.853 line:93%
If I could've afforded your college tuition,

00:44:58.853 --> 00:45:01.724 line:93%
would you not have told me before giving up?

00:45:02.483 --> 00:45:05.153 line:93%
No, you wouldn't have even given up.

00:45:08.224 --> 00:45:09.523 line:93%
Ji Tae.

00:45:10.264 --> 00:45:13.733 line:93%
Do you know how cheerful and considerate you were?

00:45:15.034 --> 00:45:16.233 line:93%
After the bankruptcy,

00:45:16.574 --> 00:45:19.574 line:93%
you clammed up whenever you came home.

00:45:19.574 --> 00:45:22.644 line:93%
You stopped smiling and didn't talk with me.

00:45:22.874 --> 00:45:24.213 line:93%
You never made eye contact either.

00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:28.514 line:93%
That was because I was still in shock.

00:45:30.054 --> 00:45:31.554 line:93%
I know that.

00:45:32.983 --> 00:45:34.724 line:93%
We went from being rich...

00:45:34.724 --> 00:45:36.824 line:93%
to living in a small room in a day.

00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:39.793 line:93%
How could you smile about that?

00:45:40.364 --> 00:45:42.764 line:93%
You became worried about your future, annoyed,

00:45:43.063 --> 00:45:45.034 line:93%
and hated me.

00:45:45.434 --> 00:45:46.534 line:93%
I know.

00:45:47.133 --> 00:45:48.704 line:93%
Then why complain?

00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:50.603 line:93%
Just because I know...

00:45:51.534 --> 00:45:53.344 line:93%
and understand you all...

00:45:54.344 --> 00:45:56.313 line:93%
doesn't mean I didn't feel miserable.

00:45:58.773 --> 00:46:00.043 line:93%
I felt terrible.

00:46:00.684 --> 00:46:02.443 line:93%
I didn't know what to do.

00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:04.883 line:93%
I felt terrible, but I didn't have the energy...

00:46:04.883 --> 00:46:06.653 line:93%
to tell you not to worry.

00:46:07.423 --> 00:46:09.224 line:93%
So I cowed around you.

00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:11.494 line:93%
Ji Tae, Ji An, Ji Soo, Ji Ho,

00:46:12.494 --> 00:46:13.693 line:93%
and you.

00:46:15.293 --> 00:46:17.034 line:93%
I cowed around you.

00:46:17.693 --> 00:46:20.164 line:93%
No one talked, discussed anything,

00:46:20.164 --> 00:46:21.833 line:93%
or chatted with me.

00:46:22.764 --> 00:46:24.773 line:93%
You all just smiled.

00:46:25.874 --> 00:46:28.644 line:93%
I pretended not to care and smiled along.

00:46:29.603 --> 00:46:30.813 line:93%
However,

00:46:31.773 --> 00:46:35.514 line:93%
now, I'm sick of tiptoeing around you all the time.

00:46:38.014 --> 00:46:39.284 line:93%
Now, I know...

00:46:39.983 --> 00:46:43.554 line:93%
that I was a useless and meaningless father.

00:46:44.923 --> 00:46:46.664 line:93%
And an untrustworthy husband.

00:46:48.494 --> 00:46:51.764 line:93%
So I'm going to live my own life now.

00:46:52.233 --> 00:46:54.103 line:93%
I'll make money on the fishing vessel...

00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:57.273 line:93%
and do everything I wanted but couldn't do.

00:46:57.934 --> 00:47:00.043 line:93%
So don't interfere with my life from now on.

00:47:00.903 --> 00:47:04.014 line:93%
You have a way of shutting us up.

00:47:05.844 --> 00:47:07.313 line:93%
Yes, that's it.

00:47:07.784 --> 00:47:09.213 line:93%
That's what I want.

00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:11.784 line:93%
Stay out of my business.

00:47:13.583 --> 00:47:15.483 line:93%
Okay, fine.

00:47:26.034 --> 00:47:28.563 line:93%
Can't he just show us the results?

00:47:51.494 --> 00:47:52.963 line:93%
Will you really...

00:47:53.724 --> 00:47:55.494 line:93%
stay angry until you leave?

00:47:56.293 --> 00:47:57.894 line:93%
Why do I care?

00:47:58.563 --> 00:48:02.003 line:93%
You mean nothing to me now.

00:48:04.603 --> 00:48:06.503 line:93%
When a couple loses trust,

00:48:06.744 --> 00:48:08.574 line:93%
we're as good as strangers.

00:48:10.344 --> 00:48:11.474 line:93%
Honey.

00:48:12.414 --> 00:48:14.244 line:93%
I said I'm sorry.

00:48:36.403 --> 00:48:38.534 line:93%
When your dad refused to give me your number,

00:48:38.804 --> 00:48:40.043 line:93%
I knew something was up.

00:48:40.903 --> 00:48:43.414 line:93%
I want you to think about who you used to be...

00:48:43.773 --> 00:48:45.713 line:93%
and what kind of person you once were.

00:48:45.974 --> 00:48:48.443 line:93%
Just think about that once more.

00:48:48.943 --> 00:48:50.313 line:93%
Only you can shine light...

00:48:50.583 --> 00:48:52.883 line:93%
upon the road you wish to take.

00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:55.753 line:93%
Why did he say that instead of saying...

00:48:56.454 --> 00:48:58.324 line:93%
Ms. No had come over?

00:49:01.364 --> 00:49:03.534 line:93%
(Contact List, Dad)

00:49:06.434 --> 00:49:08.633 line:93%
The phone is turned off.

00:49:08.633 --> 00:49:10.974 line:93%
Please leave a message after...

00:49:17.844 --> 00:49:21.383 line:93%
Well, dad turned his phone off.

00:49:21.983 --> 00:49:23.983 line:93%
Is he working now?

00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:26.583 line:93%
I was wondering...

00:49:27.583 --> 00:49:29.583 line:93%
if I should call you or not.

00:49:30.554 --> 00:49:31.894 line:93%
Is something wrong?

00:49:38.633 --> 00:49:41.264 line:93%
Close your mouth. You look like an idiot.

00:49:44.204 --> 00:49:45.704 line:93%
It all makes sense now.

00:49:46.903 --> 00:49:48.974 line:93%
Why you were fixated on Ji An.

00:49:50.043 --> 00:49:51.273 line:93%
I found it odd.

00:49:52.644 --> 00:49:55.083 line:93%
You met a few times by that car accident...

00:49:55.383 --> 00:49:56.954 line:93%
and met again at work.

00:49:58.083 --> 00:50:01.454 line:93%
I didn't think that was enough to fall in love.

00:50:03.753 --> 00:50:05.853 line:93%
But there was much more to it.

00:50:06.894 --> 00:50:09.293 line:93%
No wonder it was so messed up.

00:50:09.594 --> 00:50:11.534 line:93%
It'll barely work even if we worked together...

00:50:11.864 --> 00:50:13.563 line:93%
but Ji An won't cooperate.

00:50:13.864 --> 00:50:15.664 line:93%
Her head's screwed on right.

00:50:15.934 --> 00:50:17.273 line:93%
You're the crazy one.

00:50:18.103 --> 00:50:21.874 line:93%
There's no way your family will accept her.

00:50:23.574 --> 00:50:26.313 line:93%
She belongs to the creeps who stole their daughter.

00:50:26.313 --> 00:50:27.443 line:93%
"Creeps"?

00:50:27.983 --> 00:50:29.514 line:93%
Watch your language.

00:50:32.213 --> 00:50:33.423 line:93%
This won't work out...

00:50:34.583 --> 00:50:37.824 line:93%
unless you scratch your name off the family tree.

00:50:37.994 --> 00:50:40.764 line:93%
But you won't do that, would you?

00:50:41.063 --> 00:50:42.764 line:93%
I left without a penny.

00:50:42.764 --> 00:50:43.864 line:93%
No.

00:50:44.133 --> 00:50:46.603 line:93%
If you really turned your back on Haesung,

00:50:47.133 --> 00:50:48.704 line:93%
why won't you spend your money?

00:50:49.534 --> 00:50:51.474 line:93%
You got it when you started preschool.

00:50:51.474 --> 00:50:52.833 line:93%
It's already yours.

00:50:53.003 --> 00:50:54.403 line:93%
You won't spend it...

00:50:55.103 --> 00:50:57.273 line:93%
because you're going to go back.

00:50:57.344 --> 00:50:59.344 line:93%
You're sticking to the Haesung rules.

00:50:59.344 --> 00:51:01.483 line:93%
Because I left to win over Ji An.

00:51:02.083 --> 00:51:03.353 line:93%
Being independent...

00:51:03.353 --> 00:51:05.813 line:93%
will free me from my grandpa and parents.

00:51:06.753 --> 00:51:08.253 line:93%
Haesung can absorb...

00:51:08.253 --> 00:51:09.954 line:93%
the company I started.

00:51:11.523 --> 00:51:13.063 line:93%
It won't work like that.

00:51:13.364 --> 00:51:14.563 line:93%
I can do it.

00:51:14.563 --> 00:51:15.894 line:93%
The investment will come in today.

00:51:17.364 --> 00:51:19.133 line:93%
Ji An's refusal is a bigger the problem.

00:51:19.364 --> 00:51:21.833 line:93%
She refused? What did she refuse?

00:51:22.063 --> 00:51:24.173 line:93%
She doesn't want to be part of Haesung.

00:51:25.003 --> 00:51:26.874 line:93%
And she hates me because I'm from that family.

00:51:26.874 --> 00:51:27.903 line:93%
What?

00:51:29.974 --> 00:51:32.574 line:93%
She won't even look at what she can't have.

00:51:32.713 --> 00:51:33.813 line:93%
No.

00:51:34.983 --> 00:51:37.713 line:93%
She found what makes her happy in her situation.

00:51:37.753 --> 00:51:38.983 line:93%
You believe that?

00:51:39.983 --> 00:51:41.583 line:93%
What woman...

00:51:41.583 --> 00:51:44.094 line:93%
would refuse to marry the heir of Haesung?

00:51:46.193 --> 00:51:47.923 line:93%
She sounded serious.

00:51:48.624 --> 00:51:50.733 line:93%
First, gain independence.

00:51:51.594 --> 00:51:53.804 line:93%
Show her that you're able to stand...

00:51:53.804 --> 00:51:55.833 line:93%
away from Mr. No and your mom.

00:51:56.164 --> 00:51:57.173 line:93%
Then ask again...

00:51:57.503 --> 00:51:59.003 line:93%
and see what she says.

00:52:00.173 --> 00:52:01.344 line:93%
Would that work?

00:52:02.744 --> 00:52:04.014 line:93%
Really?

00:52:04.014 --> 00:52:05.114 line:93%
I'm sure about that.

00:52:05.414 --> 00:52:07.443 line:93%
She doesn't trust you right now.

00:52:08.644 --> 00:52:09.713 line:93%
What if...

00:52:10.454 --> 00:52:12.083 line:93%
she's serious?

00:52:13.583 --> 00:52:15.653 line:93%
What if she dislikes my heritage?

00:52:15.983 --> 00:52:17.353 line:93%
Then it's over.

00:52:18.293 --> 00:52:19.693 line:93%
There's no room to negotiate.

00:52:27.063 --> 00:52:29.304 line:93%
You said things were favorable.

00:52:30.204 --> 00:52:31.633 line:93%
What changed?

00:52:32.374 --> 00:52:33.804 line:93%
We had a meeting and...

00:52:33.804 --> 00:52:36.204 line:93%
the directors don't see the merit of investing.

00:52:36.374 --> 00:52:37.673 line:93%
Goodbye then.

Hello.

00:52:55.864 --> 00:52:57.963 line:93%
I don't think we can help you.

00:52:57.963 --> 00:53:00.733 line:93%
But you said you're short of work...

00:53:01.003 --> 00:53:02.633 line:93%
so the OEM would be possible.

00:53:05.474 --> 00:53:07.443 line:93%
Your CEO said no?

00:53:23.894 --> 00:53:25.153 line:93%
Yes, Choi Do Kyung speaking.

00:53:25.153 --> 00:53:28.164 line:93%
I'm sorry. We dismissed your proposal.

00:53:28.193 --> 00:53:31.534 line:93%
What? The audit process is over already?

Yes.

00:54:00.164 --> 00:54:01.824 line:93%
It's done already?

00:54:03.364 --> 00:54:04.434 line:93%
Thanks.

00:54:10.403 --> 00:54:11.903 line:93%
Do Kyung will return soon.

00:54:12.503 --> 00:54:15.003 line:93%
He will? How?

00:54:15.503 --> 00:54:17.114 line:93%
I broke his legs.

00:54:18.773 --> 00:54:21.344 line:93%
He doesn't know he can't get away from me.

00:54:22.244 --> 00:54:24.713 line:93%
He was raised to think he's special.

00:54:25.414 --> 00:54:27.224 line:93%
He forgot he owes us.

00:54:35.164 --> 00:54:36.494 line:93%
I lost my passbook.

00:54:36.494 --> 00:54:37.633 line:93%

I'm going to see a client. I'll drop you off.

Thanks. It's really cold.

00:55:22.204 --> 00:55:24.574 line:93%
He's getting on fine with Ji An,

00:55:25.914 --> 00:55:28.614 line:93%
but he complained that I dumped him?

00:55:31.184 --> 00:55:32.653 line:93%

I'm home.

00:56:28.874 --> 00:56:29.874 line:93%
What for?

00:56:29.874 --> 00:56:31.744 line:93%
Don't even sit if you came here to nag me.

00:56:34.644 --> 00:56:36.784 line:93%
Why is it nagging...

00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:38.583 line:93%
if it's about your health?

00:56:39.353 --> 00:56:41.423 line:93%
You don't need to get involved.

00:56:41.423 --> 00:56:43.324 line:93%
I can manage my own health.

Let me take you to a doctor tomorrow.

00:56:47.224 --> 00:56:48.293 line:93%
What?

00:56:48.664 --> 00:56:50.133 line:93%
The checkup you got...

00:56:50.133 --> 00:56:51.894 line:93%
was from a small clinic.

00:56:51.894 --> 00:56:53.563 line:93%
That's why you won't show the results.

00:56:54.864 --> 00:56:56.804 line:93%
And you can't go deep-sea fishing.

00:56:57.233 --> 00:56:59.103 line:93%
That's such hard work.

00:56:59.304 --> 00:57:00.943 line:93%
I made up my mind.

00:57:00.943 --> 00:57:02.304 line:93%
Don't bother me, and go.

00:57:04.443 --> 00:57:05.574 line:93%
Dad.

00:57:06.784 --> 00:57:09.443 line:93%
I'm really sorry.

00:57:09.713 --> 00:57:11.514 line:93%
Stop being angry with me.

00:57:16.624 --> 00:57:18.554 line:93%
Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:57:19.423 --> 00:57:21.824 line:93%
You need to think about my circumstances too.

00:57:28.003 --> 00:57:29.133 line:93%
Your "circumstances"?

00:57:29.903 --> 00:57:32.374 line:93%
How we duped you into living with that family?

00:57:34.773 --> 00:57:35.943 line:93%
I wasn't...

00:57:37.173 --> 00:57:40.514 line:93%
able to face you after that.

00:57:42.244 --> 00:57:43.313 line:93%
Is that so?

00:57:44.483 --> 00:57:46.824 line:93%
It was in my situation.

00:57:47.784 --> 00:57:50.054 line:93%
Why should I consider your situation?

00:57:50.724 --> 00:57:53.624 line:93%
Did you ever tell me how you felt?

00:57:54.423 --> 00:57:55.693 line:93%
After what you did,

00:57:55.693 --> 00:57:57.434 line:93%
don't you dare pretend you care now.

00:57:58.764 --> 00:58:02.003 line:93%
Did you think about it from my perspective?

00:58:03.434 --> 00:58:05.103 line:93%
I did so many times.

00:58:05.673 --> 00:58:07.673 line:93%
I felt terribly bad...

00:58:08.074 --> 00:58:10.144 line:93%
for how I treated you when I left.

00:58:10.974 --> 00:58:13.344 line:93%
Yes. You left.

00:58:14.014 --> 00:58:15.443 line:93%
You left.

00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:20.124 line:93%
I thought you'd say you wouldn't go.

00:58:20.724 --> 00:58:23.324 line:93%
Even if you really were their daughter,

00:58:23.594 --> 00:58:25.994 line:93%
I didn't think you'd say you'd go right away.

00:58:26.463 --> 00:58:28.793 line:93%
You were my daughter for 28 years.

00:58:29.193 --> 00:58:32.364 line:93%
It didn't take you a month or two, or even a week.

00:58:32.693 --> 00:58:36.304 line:93%
Three days. That's all it took for you to say yes.

00:58:37.773 --> 00:58:40.874 line:93%
You left while blaming me for being poor.

00:58:43.414 --> 00:58:45.644 line:93%
I first met you to talk you out of it.

00:58:45.874 --> 00:58:48.313 line:93%
To say that it's not you, and that you shouldn't go.

00:58:49.583 --> 00:58:51.114 line:93%
You already made up your mind,

00:58:51.114 --> 00:58:53.023 line:93%
but I didn't want to hurt you,

00:58:53.253 --> 00:58:54.624 line:93%
so I kept asking...

00:58:55.653 --> 00:58:57.793 line:93%
if you were leaving because of...

00:58:57.793 --> 00:58:59.594 line:93%
what your mom had done.

00:59:00.563 --> 00:59:01.624 line:93%
I thought...

00:59:02.264 --> 00:59:03.934 line:93%
you have made up your mind...

00:59:03.934 --> 00:59:05.733 line:93%
in a hurry for our sake.

00:59:07.063 --> 00:59:08.434 line:93%
Ji An.

00:59:09.903 --> 00:59:10.974 line:93%
You can't...

00:59:12.173 --> 00:59:13.543 line:93%
go there.

00:59:14.503 --> 00:59:15.543 line:93%
I'm sorry...

00:59:16.514 --> 00:59:17.773 line:93%
for all...

00:59:18.043 --> 00:59:20.144 line:93%
the tough times you went through.

00:59:20.614 --> 00:59:22.483 line:93%
It's about what you want.

00:59:22.943 --> 00:59:24.554 line:93%
That's what counts.

00:59:25.583 --> 00:59:27.624 line:93%
I... I want to know what you're thinking.

00:59:27.624 --> 00:59:30.653 line:93%
If they say you don't have to move in,

00:59:31.353 --> 00:59:32.753 line:93%
will you stay here?

00:59:33.824 --> 00:59:36.224 line:93%
I wanted to hear you say you had no choice.

00:59:37.063 --> 00:59:39.333 line:93%
Only then, would you be less perplexed...

00:59:39.664 --> 00:59:41.563 line:93%
even if I told you the truth,

00:59:42.103 --> 00:59:43.103 line:93%
Yes.

00:59:44.173 --> 00:59:45.434 line:93%
I want to go.

00:59:46.574 --> 00:59:48.644 line:93%
I struggled so much until now.

00:59:48.744 --> 00:59:50.014 line:93%
I wanted to die every day.

00:59:50.014 --> 00:59:51.874 line:93%
My efforts alone wouldn't cut it.

00:59:51.874 --> 00:59:54.813 line:93%
Why did you pick me up in the first place?

00:59:55.844 --> 00:59:57.684 line:93%
I never thought...

00:59:57.914 --> 00:59:59.923 line:93%
that I'd hear my own daughter say...

00:59:59.923 --> 01:00:01.724 line:93%
she wanted to die.

01:00:03.423 --> 01:00:05.554 line:93%
I looked into your eyes,

01:00:06.253 --> 01:00:07.923 line:93%
and I couldn't speak.

01:00:08.793 --> 01:00:11.193 line:93%
You asked me why I'd adopted you.

01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.304 line:93%
I needed to say...

01:00:13.304 --> 01:00:15.304 line:93%
it was Ji Soo and not you.

01:00:16.434 --> 01:00:17.974 line:93%
But my mouth froze...

01:00:18.434 --> 01:00:20.273 line:93%
and my heart stopped.

01:00:21.144 --> 01:00:22.804 line:93%
I couldn't move...

01:00:24.014 --> 01:00:25.673 line:93%
as if I was having a nightmare.

01:00:27.983 --> 01:00:29.383 line:93%
I'm sorry.

01:00:30.554 --> 01:00:31.614 line:93%
No.

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:34.523 line:93%
It's possible for you to do that.

01:00:35.253 --> 01:00:37.594 line:93%
You must've struggled so much.

01:00:38.153 --> 01:00:40.624 line:93%
So I'm sorry...

01:00:40.994 --> 01:00:42.324 line:93%
and sorry again.

01:00:43.094 --> 01:00:44.164 line:93%
But...

01:00:44.963 --> 01:00:47.164 line:93%
it's not fine for me.

01:00:47.903 --> 01:00:51.133 line:93%
I was rejected by my own daughter.

01:00:51.574 --> 01:00:54.804 line:93%
Even when you realized it was Ji Soo,

01:00:54.804 --> 01:00:56.173 line:93%
you didn't come look for me.

01:00:57.114 --> 01:00:59.514 line:93%
"Dad, I'm in trouble."

01:01:00.184 --> 01:01:03.353 line:93%
That's what you and Ji Tae always said...

01:01:05.114 --> 01:01:07.054 line:93%
when I was still competent.

01:01:08.883 --> 01:01:10.293 line:93%
Dad.

01:01:12.153 --> 01:01:15.693 line:93%
You made me realize that I'm a useless dad,

01:01:15.864 --> 01:01:17.364 line:93%
and I've realized it.

01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:18.934 line:93%
So...

01:01:19.764 --> 01:01:21.633 line:93%
leave me alone now.

01:01:22.733 --> 01:01:24.034 line:93%
I'm sorry.

01:01:24.074 --> 01:01:25.974 line:93%
Don't say that anymore.

01:01:27.574 --> 01:01:28.874 line:93%
I don't need it.

01:01:29.304 --> 01:01:30.914 line:93%
I don't want it anymore.

01:01:31.543 --> 01:01:32.673 line:93%
You guys.

01:02:32.474 --> 01:02:33.673 line:93%
I'm sick...

01:02:34.903 --> 01:02:36.414 line:93%
of living like this.

01:02:37.543 --> 01:02:40.083 line:93%
People ignore me and despise me.

01:02:40.514 --> 01:02:43.353 line:93%
Living a miserable and servile life.

01:02:44.253 --> 01:02:45.983 line:93%
I can't take it anymore. No.

01:02:47.454 --> 01:02:49.124 line:93%
Why do you not want me to go?

01:02:49.324 --> 01:02:52.293 line:93%
Why did you pick me up in the first place?

01:03:39.003 --> 01:03:41.943 line:93%
Why are you waiting here? Someone might follow you.

01:03:44.744 --> 01:03:46.014 line:93%
Are you that scared?

01:04:00.693 --> 01:04:03.594 line:93%
I am. I'm very terrified.

01:04:05.063 --> 01:04:06.563 line:93%
So what are you going to do for me?

01:04:12.233 --> 01:04:13.503 line:93%
I'll ask you only one question.

01:04:14.673 --> 01:04:15.943 line:93%
Please answer it.

01:04:18.673 --> 01:04:20.014 line:93%
Do you...

01:04:21.043 --> 01:04:22.313 line:93%
really mean that?

01:04:24.153 --> 01:04:26.284 line:93%
If you really meant it when you said...

01:04:28.153 --> 01:04:29.454 line:93%
that I must not be the son of Haesung Corporation,

01:04:30.253 --> 01:04:31.293 line:93%
I'll...

01:04:32.653 --> 01:04:34.224 line:93%
stop now.

01:04:38.994 --> 01:04:40.333 line:93%
Answer me.

01:04:44.204 --> 01:04:45.434 line:93%
I really meant it.

01:04:45.574 --> 01:04:46.704 line:93%
Then...

01:04:47.744 --> 01:04:48.744 line:93%
let's stop this.

01:04:50.443 --> 01:04:51.744 line:93%
If you really meant it,

01:04:54.114 --> 01:04:55.784 line:93%
I can't help it.

01:04:57.684 --> 01:04:59.083 line:93%
Even if I die,

01:05:00.753 --> 01:05:02.994 line:93%
I'll still be the son of Haesung Corporation.

01:05:10.563 --> 01:05:11.764 line:93%
However,

01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:14.103 line:93%
you must remember this.

01:05:15.664 --> 01:05:16.773 line:93%
When I say...

01:05:18.204 --> 01:05:19.903 line:93%
I won't do something, I really mean it.

01:05:22.074 --> 01:05:23.313 line:93%
Like you said,

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:27.344 line:93%
I can't stop being myself for you.

01:05:30.554 --> 01:05:31.684 line:93%
Okay.

01:05:35.224 --> 01:05:36.954 line:93%
I'll give you one last chance.

01:05:38.994 --> 01:05:40.124 line:93%
Don't let me go.

01:05:57.713 --> 01:05:58.943 line:93%
Then it's over.

01:06:00.014 --> 01:06:01.244 line:93%
Goodbye.

01:06:47.164 --> 01:06:49.633 line:93%
(My Golden Life)

01:06:51.994 --> 01:06:53.733 line:93%
Why are you so hard to get?

01:06:54.403 --> 01:06:56.264 line:93%
Act like you're my boyfriend.

01:06:56.264 --> 01:06:58.233 line:93%
Hi. He's my boyfriend.

01:07:00.074 --> 01:07:01.173 line:93%
We need to talk.

01:07:01.403 --> 01:07:03.043 line:93%
Do Kyung will be home soon.

01:07:03.043 --> 01:07:05.374 line:93%
Father blocked all of Do Kyung's investments.

01:07:05.374 --> 01:07:07.784 line:93%
I don't want to live as a horse on Grandpa's chess.

01:07:07.883 --> 01:07:09.483 line:93%
How did it go with Ji An?

01:07:09.483 --> 01:07:10.753 line:93%
I'll try to hate her.

01:07:10.914 --> 01:07:13.353 line:93%
My goodness. You did a good job.

01:07:13.653 --> 01:07:14.753 line:93%
Goodbye.

01:07:15.423 --> 01:07:16.923 line:93%
Are you Seo Tae Soo's daughter?

01:07:16.923 --> 01:07:19.764 line:93%
He collapsed and is going to the emergency room.

01:07:19.764 --> 01:07:21.193 line:93%
My father?
